The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of an integrative medicine approach to the management of asthma compared to standard clinical care on quality of life (QOL) and clinical outcomes. This was a prospective parallel group repeated measurement randomized design. Participants were adults aged 18 to 80 years with asthma. The intervention consisted of six group sessions on the use of nutritional manipulation, yoga techniques, and journaling. Participants also received nutritional supplements: fish oil, vitamin C, and a standardized hops extract. The control group received usual care. Primary outcome measures were the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-12 (SF-12), and standard pulmonary function tests (PFTs). In total, 154 patients were randomized and included in the intention-to-treat analysis (77 control, 77 treatment). Treatment participants showed greater improvement than controls at 6 months for the AQLQ total score (P<.001) and for three subscales, Activity (P< 0.001), Symptoms (P= .02), and Emotion (P<.001). Treatment participants also showed greater improvement than controls on three of the SF-12 subscales, Physical functioning (P=.003); Role limitations, Physical (P< .001); and Social functioning (P= 0.03), as well as in the aggregate scores for Physical and Mental health (P= .003 and .02, respectively). There was no change in PFTs in either group. A low-cost group-oriented integrative medicine intervention can lead to significant improvement in QOL in adults with asthma.

Helicobacter pylori is associated with benign and malignant diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract, and increasing antibiotic resistance has made alternative treatments necessary. Our aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of a new, single-capsule treatment versus the gold standard for H pylori eradication. We did a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial in 39 sites in Europe, comparing the efficacy and safety of 10 days of quadruple therapy with omeprazole plus a single three-in-one capsule containing bismuth subcitrate potassium, metronidazole, and tetracycline (quadruple therapy) versus 7 days of omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin (standard therapy) in adults with recorded H pylori infection. Patients were randomly assigned treatment according to a predetermined list independently generated by Quintiles Canada (Ville St-Laurent, QC, Canada). Our study was designed as a non-inferiority trial but was powered to detect superiority. Our primary outcome was H pylori eradication, established by two negative (13)C urea breath tests at a minimum of 28 and 56 days after the end of treatment. Our assessment for non-inferiority was in the per-protocol population, with subsequent assessment for superiority in the intention-to-treat population (ie, all participants randomly assigned treatment). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00669955. 12 participants were lost to follow-up and 101 were excluded from the per-protocol analysis. In the per-protocol population (n=339), the lower bound of the CI for treatment with quadruple therapy was greater than the pre-established non-inferiority margin of -10% (95% CI 15\u00b71-32\u00b73; p<0\u00b70001). In the intention-to-treat population (n=440), eradication rates were 80% (174 of 218 participants) in the quadruple therapy group versus 55% (123 of 222) in the standard therapy group (p<0\u00b70001). Safety profiles for both treatments were similar; main adverse events were gastrointestinal and CNS disorders.

The effect of roflumilast on lung function in patients with COPD that is moderate to severe who are already being treated with salmeterol or tiotropium was investigated. In two double-blind, multicentre studies done in an outpatient setting, after a 4-week run-in, patients older than 40 years with moderate-to-severe COPD were randomly assigned to oral roflumilast 500 microg or placebo once a day for 24 weeks, in addition to salmeterol (M2-127 study) or tiotropium (M2-128 study). The primary endpoint was change in prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)). Analysis was by intention to treat.

Similar improvement in postbronchodilator FEV(1) was noted in both groups. Furthermore, roflumilast had beneficial effects on other lung function measurements and on selected patient-reported outcomes in both groups. Nausea, diarrhoea, weight loss, and, to a lesser extent, headache were more frequent in patients in the roflumilast groups. These adverse events were associated with increased patient withdrawal.

The goal of this study was to assess the immunogenicity and antigenicity of StrataGraft skin tissue in a randomized phase I/II clinical trial for the temporary management of full-thickness skin loss. StrataGraft skin tissue consists of a dermal equivalent containing human dermal fibroblasts and a fully stratified, biologically active epidermis derived from Near-diploid Immortalized Keratinocyte S (NIKS) cells, a pathogen-free, long-lived, consistent, human keratinocyte progenitor. Traumatic skin wounds often require temporary allograft coverage to stabilize the wound bed until autografting is possible. StrataGraft and cadaveric allograft were placed side by side on 15 patients with full-thickness skin defects for 1 week before autografting. Allografts were removed from the wound bed and examined for allogeneic immune responses. Immunohistochemistry and indirect immunofluorescence were used to assess tissue structure and cellular composition of allografts. In vitro lymphocyte proliferation assays, chromium-release assays, and development of antibodies were used to examine allogeneic responses. One week after patient exposure to allografts, there were no differences in the numbers of T or B lymphocytes or Langerhans cells present in StrataGraft skin substitute compared to cadaver allograft, the standard of care. Importantly, exposure to StrataGraft skin substitute did not induce the proliferation of patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells to NIKS keratinocytes or enhance cell-mediated lysis of NIKS keratinocytes in vitro. Similarly, no evidence of antibody generation targeted to the NIKS keratinocytes was seen. These findings indicate that StrataGraft tissue is well-tolerated and not acutely immunogenic in patients with traumatic skin wounds. Notably, exposure to StrataGraft did not increase patient sensitivity toward or elicit immune responses against the NIKS keratinocytes. We envision that this novel skin tissue technology will be widely used to facilitate the healing of traumatic cutaneous wounds.This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00618839).

In study 2, we investigated the efficacy of a moderate-fat (3.5 g/serving) PS-enriched soy beverage on plasma cholesterol concentrations and cholesterol kinetic responses in 23 hypercholesterolemic subjects compared with 1% dairy milk. Both the low and moderate-fat PS-enriched soymilk varieties provided 1.95 g PS/d. Endpoint plasma variables were analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA using baseline values as covariates for plasma lipid measurements. In comparison with the 1% dairy milk control, the low-fat soy beverage reduced (P < 0.05) total and LDL-cholesterol by 10 and 13%, respectively. Consumption of the moderate-fat PS-enriched soy beverage reduced (P < 0.05) plasma total and LDL-cholesterol by 12 and 15% respectively. Fasting triglycerides were reduced by 9.4% following consumption of the moderate-fat soy beverage in comparison with the 1% dairy milk. Both low and moderate-fat PS-enriched soy varieties reduced (P < 0.05) LDL:HDL and TC:HDL ratios compared with the 1% dairy milk control. Consumption of the moderate-fat PS-enriched soymilk reduced (P < 0.05) cholesterol absorption by 27%, but did not alter cholesterol synthesis in comparison with 1% dairy milk. We conclude that, compared to 1% dairy milk, consumption of low and moderate-fat PS-enriched soy beverages represents an effective dietary strategy to reduce circulating lipid concentrations in normal to hypercholesterolemic individuals by reducing intestinal cholesterol absorption.

Osteopathic physicians have used osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) to treat patients with acute otitis media (AOM) and its sequelae (eg, middle ear effusion [MEE], conductive hearing loss) for more than a century. However, few clinical trials document the efficacy of OMM, perhaps because of various challenges related to OMM clinical trials. To describe a research protocol studying the efficacy of OMM on MEE after an episode of AOM, comment on the feasibility of the protocol and statistical analysis, and report on lessons learned in the first 9 months of the study. Dual-site, prospective, randomized, blinded, controlled clinical trial comparing OMM plus standard care to standard care only for MEE after an episode of AOM. Standard care comprised antibiotics and surgery. Patients were aged between 6 months and 24 months, were diagnosed as having AOM, were referred to the study by a participating pediatric provider, and had abnormal tympanogram results on entry into the study. All patients had 5 weekly study visits, and patients in the intervention group received OMM on visits 1 through 3. Patients received weekly tympanogram and acoustic reflectometer readings as well as daily at-home acoustic reflectometer readings for 30 days. Fifty-six patients were screened, 34 subjects were enrolled, and 26 subjects completed the study protocol in the first 9 months of the study. This resulted in 22 \"ears\" in the standard card only group and 18 \"ears\" in the standard care plus OMM group, resulting in 40 cases of AOM studied in the first year of the trial. The OMM treatment protocol was easily administered without serious adverse events. Protocols for interpretation of tympanogram readings and conversion of data for statistical analysis resulted in analyzable data. The OMM protocol can be administered with no serious adverse events. Subject recruitment is difficult, and a full-time research assistant at the referring site improves subject referral, enrollment and retention. Accepting only confirmed cases of AOM from trained pediatric providers reduces the patient pool but increases the reliability of the data. (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00520039).

Injectable formulations of diclofenac have long been available in Europe and other countries. These formulations use a default dose of 75 mg of diclofenac delivered IV over 30 to 120 minutes or as an IM injection. A novel formulation of injectable diclofenac sodium, Dyloject\u00ae, is solubilized with hydroxypropyl \u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP\u03b2CD) so that it can be given IV or IM in a small volume bolus. In this multicenter, multiple-dose, multiple-day, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group phase 3 study, we investigated whether lower doses of HP\u03b2CD diclofenac delivered as a small volume bolus would be effective for the management of acute pain after abdominal or pelvic surgery. Adults with moderate and severe pain, defined as \u226550 mm on a 0 to 100 mm visual analog scale, within 6 hours after surgery were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1 ratio) to receive HP\u03b2CD diclofenac, 18.75 mg or 37.5 mg; ketorolac tromethamine 30 mg; or placebo. Patients in all treatment arms received a bolus IV injection every 6 hours until discharged. They were observed for at least 48 h, and for up to 5 days. Rescue IV morphine was available any time, up to a total of 7.5 mg over a 3-hour period. The primary efficacy measure was the sum of pain intensity differences from 0 to 48 hours after study drug initiation. Three hundred thirty-one patients received \u22651 dose of study drug. Over the first 48 hours, both IV HP\u03b2CD diclofenac doses, as well as ketorolac, produced significant reductions in pain intensity over placebo (all P < 0.05), as well as significant reductions in the need for rescue morphine administration. Both doses of HP\u03b2CD diclofenac, as well as ketorolac, significantly reduced rescue morphine dosages, as compared to placebo (P < 0.0001), and time to rescue morphine administration was significantly increased by treatment with 18.75 mg diclofenac and ketorolac. The overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events was 20.2%. No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in either diclofenac dose group, whereas only 1 was reported in the ketorolac group.

The study was an interventional and crossover comparison. Twenty-one patients with TN were administered with LTG in comparison to CBZ. The clinical trials comprised two phases of 40 days each, with an intervening three-day washout period. The final titration in dose for LTG was 400\u00a0mg and 1,200\u00a0mg for CBZ. Efficacy of the medications involved was determined by visual analog scale (VAS) and verbal rating scale (VRS). Side effects were recorded through marking of the profiles of side effects encountered on administration of LTG and CBZ, together with baseline haematological, hepatic and renal investigations. Both on VAS and VRS assessments, in terms of proportion of patients, CBZ benefitted 90.5% (19/21) of the patients with pain relief (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), in contrast to 62% (13/21) from LTG.

The study was designed as an open-label dose-escalation study recruiting 60 pediatric patients sequentially in 4 treatment cohorts: study drugs were administered once daily for 3 days, as tablet coformulations (pyronaridine:artesunate ratios of 6:2, 9:3, and 12:4 mg/kg) and as a granule coformulation (pyronaridine:artesunate ratio of 9:3 mg/kg). The primary end points were tolerability, safety, and pharmacokinetics of pyronaridine-artesunate treatment. Efficacy was treated as a secondary outcome measure. The drugs had a good tolerability and safety profile, at all dose levels. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed a dose-dependent increase in the maximum plasma/blood concentration and the area under the curve, as well as comparable relative bioavailability for the granule coformulation.

Two hundred three patients (94.0%) completed the treatment program and returned for their three-month follow-up visits. No safety concerns were reported. These findings suggest a high rate of patient acceptability, a finding that is bolstered by the majority of patients completing the trial (90%) indicating that they would take the Polypill \"for life\" if proven to be effective in reducing CVD risk. Approximately 86% of the physicians surveyed agreed with and supported use of the Polypill for primary prevention and 93% for secondary prevention of CVD. Both the Polypill and Standard Practice resulted in marked reductions in systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and 10-year risk of CVD. However, the differences between the treatment groups were not statistically significant. We successfully completed a Polypill feasibility trial in Sri Lanka. We were able to document high acceptability of the Polypill to patients and physicians.

Recent evidence implicates the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor as a major cause of radiculopathy. Yet, whereas open-label studies with systemically delivered tumor necrosis factor inhibitors have yielded positive results, a placebo-controlled study failed to demonstrate efficacy. One variable that may have contributed to poor outcomes is low drug levels at the site of nerve inflammation. To date, no studies have evaluated the efficacy or safety of epidurally administered anti-tumor necrosis factor agents. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study was conducted to evaluate an epidural tumor necrosis factor inhibitor. Twenty-four patients with subacute lumbosacral radiculopathy were randomly assigned to receive two transforaminal epidural injections of 2, 4, or 6 mg of entanercept 2 weeks apart in successive groups of eight. In each group, two patients received epidural saline. A parallel epidural canine safety study was conducted using the same injection doses and paradigm as in the clinical study. The animal and human safety studies revealed no behavioral, neurologic, or histologic evidence of drug-related toxicity. In the clinical arm, significant improvements in leg and back pain were collectively noted for the etanercept-treated patients, but not for the saline group, one month after treatment. One patient in the saline group (17%), six patients in the 2-mg group (100%), and four patients each in the 4-mg and 6-mg groups (67%) reported at least 50% reduction in leg pain and a positive global perceived effect one month after treatment.

The ideal anticoagulant should prevent ischemic complications without increasing the risk of bleeding. Controlled anticoagulation is possible with the REG1 system, an RNA aptamer pair comprising the direct factor IXa inhibitor RB006 and its active control agent RB007. This phase 2a study included a roll-in group (n=2) treated with REG1 plus glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors followed by 2 groups randomized 5:1 to REG1 or unfractionated heparin. In group 1 (n=12), RB006 was partially reversed with RB007 after percutaneous coronary intervention and fully reversed 4 hours later. In group 2 (n=12), RB006 was fully reversed with RB007 immediately after percutaneous coronary intervention. Femoral sheaths were removed after complete reversal. Patients were pretreated with aspirin and clopidogrel. End points included major bleeding within 48 hours; composite of death, myocardial infarction, or urgent target vessel revascularization within 14 days; and pharmacodynamic measures. All cases were successful, with final Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction grade 3 flow and no angiographic thrombotic complications. There were 2 ischemic end points in the REG1 group and 1 in the unfractionated heparin group, with 1 major bleed in the unfractionated heparin group. Median activated clotting time values rose from 151 to 236 seconds after RB006. Administration of the partial RB007 dose reversed anticoagulation to an intermediate activated clotting time value of 186 seconds. Complete reversal with RB007 returned the median activated clotting time value to 144 seconds. Both reversal strategies enabled scheduled femoral sheath removal.

Vitamin E has been studied extensively in the prevention of atherosclerosis. Cross-sectional population studies as well as randomized controlled intervention trials have demonstrated conflicting results. A recent meta-analysis of these trials has emphasized the ineffectiveness of vitamin E in atherosclerosis prevention, with a possibility of harm at higher dosages. However, vitamin E has several isomers, with the alpha form being available via dietary supplements and the gamma form being available via dietary foodstuffs. The gamma form of vitamin E demonstrates several superior properties (such as trapping reactive nitrogen species and detoxifying nitrogen dioxide) compared with alpha vitamin E. All clinical trials have used the alpha isomer, with little concern that this isomer of vitamin E may actually suppress the gamma isomer of vitamin E. We undertook a dose-response study in volunteers with type 2 diabetes mellitus to include all the dosages of alpha vitamin E that have been used in cardiovascular prevention trials to determine the effect of alpha vitamin E on gamma vitamin E. We also assessed the effect of alpha vitamin E on several traditional markers of atherosclerotic risk. We added vitamin C to the vitamin E because several clinical trials included this vitamin to enhance the antioxidant effects of alpha vitamin E. Volunteers received, in randomized order for a 2-week period, one of the following vitamin dosage arms: (1) no vitamins, (2) low-dose supplemental vitamins E plus C, (3) medium-dose supplemental vitamins E plus C, and (4) high-dose supplemental vitamins E plus C. Blood levels of both alpha and gamma vitamin E were measured as well as surrogate markers of oxidative stress, hypercoagulation, and inflammation during a high-fat atherogenic meal (to increase the ambient oxidative stress level during the study). The results demonstrate that alpha vitamin E levels increased in proportion to the dose administered. However, at every dose of alpha vitamin E, gamma vitamin E concentration was significantly suppressed. No beneficial changes in surrogate markers of atherosclerosis were observed, consistent with the negative results of prospective clinical trials using alpha vitamin E. Our results suggest that all prospective cardiovascular clinical trials that used vitamin E supplementation actually suppressed the beneficial antioxidant gamma isomer of vitamin E. No beneficial effects on several potential cardiovascular risk factors were observed, even when the vitamin E was supplemented with vitamin C. If a standardized preparation of gamma vitamin E (without the alpha isomer) becomes available, the effects of gamma vitamin E on atherosclerotic risk will warrant additional studies.

Patients received imatinib 400 mg/day. At three months, dose was increased if complete hematologic response was not achieved. At six months, patients in complete cytogenetic response were kept on 400 mg and the remainder randomized to higher imatinib dose or 400 mg plus interferon-alfa. At 18 months, randomized patients were switched to a 2(nd) generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor if not in complete cytogenetic response and imatinib dose increased in non-randomized patients not in major molecular response. Seventy-two percent of patients started imatinib within one month from diagnosis. Median follow-up is 50.5 (range: 1.2-78) months. At three months 4 patients did not have complete hematologic response; at six months 73.8% were in complete cytogenetic response; among the remainder, 9 could not be randomized (toxicity or consent withdrawal), 17 were assigned to high imatinib dose, and 15 to 400 mg + interferon-alpha. The low number of randomized patients precluded comparison between the two arms. Cumulative response at three years was: complete hematologic response 98.6%, complete cytogenetic response 90% and major molecular response 82%. On an intention-to-treat basis, complete cytogenetic response was 78.8% at 18 months. At five years, survival was 97.5%, survival free from accelerated/blastic phase 94.3%, failure free survival 82.5%, and event free survival (including permanent imatinib discontinuation) 71.5%. These results indicate the benefit of early intervention during imatinib therapy (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00390897).

The aims of the present study were to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of IgPro20 (Hizentra\u00ae), a new 20% subcutaneous IgG solution, and compare the area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) with that of a similar intravenous 10% IgG solution (IgPro10; Privigen\u00ae). At the request of the US FDA, an algorithm for determining IgG trough level ratios (TLRs) was developed in order to provide physicians with a practical tool for monitoring doses during steady-state IgPro20 therapy. This was a prospective, open-label, multicentre, single-arm, phase III clinical trial conducted in the US. The study was performed in a primary-care setting. Eligible patients were males or females aged 6-75 years with a primary immunodeficiency (common variable immunodeficiency or X-linked agammaglobulinaemia) who had received regular treatment with IgPro10 for at least 3 months prior to entering this study and had achieved serum trough concentration (C(trough)) values \u22655 g/L.

Presence at baseline of at least 3 focal lesions (FLs; 44% of cases), a standardized uptake value (SUV) > 4.2 (46%), and extramedullary disease (EMD; 6%) adversely affected 4-year estimates of progression-free survival (PFS; \u2265 3 FLs: 50%; SUV > 4.2: 43%; presence of EMD: 28%). SUV > 4.2 and EMD were also correlated with shorter overall survival (OS; 4-year rates: 77% and 66%, respectively). Persistence of SUV > 4.2 after TD induction was an early predictor for shorter PFS. Three months after ASCT, PET/CT was negative in 65% of patients whose 4-year rates of PFS and OS were superior to those of PET-positive patients (PFS: 66% and OS: 89%). In a multivariate analysis, both EMD and SUV > 4.2 at baseline and persistence of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake after ASCT were independent variables adversely affecting PFS.

Stent coating with biodegradable polymers as a platform for elution of drugs has the potential for complete elution of drugs and for decreasing the risk of late complications. Multicenter randomized trial comparing a paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) coated with a biodegradable polymer and glycocalyx with the equivalent BMS. We randomly assigned 422 patients with de novo coronary lesions to PES (211 patients) or to BMS (211 patients). Primary end point was target vessel failure (TVF) defined as cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization. Clinical secondary end points were target vessel revascularization, target lesion revascularization, stent thrombosis (ST), and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Angiographic secondary end points were late loss and binary restenosis. At 1 year of follow-up, TVF rate was 9.5% in the PES group and 17.1% in the BMS group (P=0.02), and MACE rate was 10% in PES and 19% in BMS arm (P=0.009).

In a multicenter, randomized study, 1107 volunteers >60 years of age received intradermal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine containing 15 or 21 microg of hemagglutinin per strain or intramuscular control vaccine. Intradermal vaccines used a novel microinjection system designed to ensure easy, convenient, consistent vaccination.

Groups were compared using noninferiority and superiority analyses. For each strain, the GMTs noted in association with each intradermal vaccine were superior to those noted with the intramuscular control (adjusted P< .0001). Seroprotection rates, seroconversion rates, and mean titer increases were also superior for intradermally administered vaccine in all but one of the analyses undertaken. Systemic reactogenicity was comparable between routes. Local injection site reactions, particularly erythema but not pain, were more commonly associated with intradermal vaccination. For the first time, the intradermal vaccination route has been used to elicit immune responses significantly superior to those noted in association with the conventional intramuscular vaccination route.

Indacaterol is a novel, inhaled, once-daily, ultra-long-acting \u03b22-agonist for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This randomized, double-blind study compared the bronchodilator efficacy of indacaterol with that of placebo and tiotropium in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. In an incomplete-block, multi-dose, three-period, crossover design, patients received three of the following four treatments: indacaterol 150 \u03bcg, indacaterol 300 \u03bcg, tiotropium 18 \u03bcg and placebo, each once-daily for 14 days. Each treatment period was separated by a 14-day washout. Study drug was supplied daily by blinded, third party study personnel to maintain blinding of patients and investigators. The primary efficacy variable was trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) at 24 h post-dose after 14 days. The study was powered to demonstrate non-inferiority of indacaterol to tiotropium for this variable. A total of 169 patients were randomized (mean age 65 years); 153 (90.5%) completed. Trough FEV1 after 14 days with indacaterol 150 \u03bcg and 300 \u03bcg was statistically and clinically superior to placebo, with differences (95% CI) of 170 (120-220) and 150 (100-200) mL respectively (both p < 0.001). For this endpoint, both doses of indacaterol not only met the criterion for non-inferiority compared with tiotropium, but also achieved numerically higher values, with differences versus tiotropium of 40 and 30 mL for indacaterol 150 and 300 \u03bcg, respectively. At 5 min post-dose on Day 1, the mean FEV1 for both indacaterol doses was significantly higher than placebo (by 120 and 130 mL for indacaterol 150 and 300 \u03bcg, respectively; p < 0.001) and tiotropium (by 80 mL for both doses; p < 0.001).

Once-daily indacaterol provided clinically and statistically significant 24-h bronchodilation. Indacaterol was at least as effective as tiotropium, with a faster onset of action (within 5 min) on the first day of dosing.

Eighty-seven participants were recruited from a DM registry of a single regional Veterans Affairs medical center to participate in an open, randomized comparative effectiveness study. Two primary care-based DM group interventions of 3 months' duration were compared. Empowering Patients in Care (EPIC) was a clinician-led, patient-centered group clinic consisting of 4 sessions on setting self-management action plans (diet, exercise, home monitoring, medications, etc) and communicating about progress with action plans. The comparison intervention consisted of group education sessions with a DM educator and dietician followed by an additional visit with one's primary care provider. Hemoglobin A(1c) levels were compared after intervention and at the 1-year follow-up. Participants in the EPIC intervention had significantly greater improvements in HbA(1c) levels immediately following the active intervention (8.86%-8.04% vs 8.74%-8.70% of total hemoglobin; mean [SD] between-group difference 0.67% [1.3%]; P=.03), and these differences persisted at the 1 year follow-up (0.59% [1.4%], P=.05). A repeated-measures analysis using all study time points found a significant time-by-treatment interaction effect on HbA(1c) levels favoring the EPIC intervention (F(2,85)=3.55; P=.03).

This study investigated the administration time-dependent effects of ramipril on ambulatory blood pressure. We studied 115 untreated hypertensive patients, 46.7+/-11.2 years of age, randomly assigned to receive ramipril (5 mg/d) as a monotherapy either on awakening or at bedtime. Blood pressure was measured for 48 hours before and after 6 weeks of treatment. The blood pressure reduction during diurnal activity was similar for both treatment times. Bedtime administration of ramipril, however, was significantly more efficient than morning administration in reducing asleep blood pressure. The awake:asleep blood pressure ratio was decreased after ramipril on awakening but significantly increased toward a more dipping pattern after bedtime dosing. The proportion of patients with controlled ambulatory blood pressure increased from 43% to 65% (P=0.019) with bedtime treatment. Nocturnal blood pressure regulation is significantly better achieved at bedtime as compared with morning administration of ramipril, without any loss in efficacy during diurnal active hours. This might be clinically important, because nighttime blood pressure has been shown to be a more relevant marker of cardiovascular risk than diurnal mean values. The change in the dose-response curve, increased proportion of controlled patients, and improved efficacy on nighttime blood pressure with administration of ramipril at bedtime should be taken into account when prescribing this angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for treatment of essential hypertension.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of an intraoral electrostimulation device, consisting of stimulating electrodes, an electronic circuit, and a power source, in treating xerostomia. The device delivers electrostimulation through the oral mucosa to the lingual nerve in order to enhance the salivary reflex. The device was tested on a sample of patients with xerostomia due to Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and other sicca conditions in a 2-stage prospective, randomized, multicenter trial. Stage I was a double-blind, crossover stage designed to compare the effects of the electrically active device with the sham device, each used for 1 month, and stage II was a 3-month open-label stage designed to assess the long-term effects of the active device. Improvement in xerostomia severity from baseline was the primary outcome measure. A total of 114 patients were randomized. In stage I, the active device performed better than the sham device for patient-reported xerostomia severity (P<0.002), xerostomia frequency (P<0.05), quality of life impairment (P<0.01), and swallowing difficulty (P<0.02). At the end of stage II, statistically significant improvements were verified for patient-reported xerostomia severity (P<0.0001), xerostomia frequency (P<0.0001), oral discomfort (P<0.001), speech difficulty (P<0.02), sleeping difficulty (P<0.001), and resting salivary flow rate (P<0.01). Our findings indicate that daily use of the device alleviated oral dryness, discomfort, and some complications of xerostomia, such as speech and sleeping difficulties, and increased salivary output.

We now compared the outcomes of these patients 3.7 yr later. Fifty-one of the 63 original patients (28 euthyroid, 23 hypothyroid) participated. Forty-eight received rhTSH and serum thyroglobulin (Tg) sampling. A (131)I whole-body scan was performed in 43 patients, and successful ablation was defined by criteria from the previous study. Based on the criterion of uptake less than 0.1% in thyroid bed, 100% (43 of 43) remained ablated. When no visible uptake instead was used, five patients (four euthyroid, one hypothyroid) had minimal visible activity. When the TSH-stimulated Tg criterion was used, only two of 45 (one euthyroid, one hypothyroid) had a stimulated Tg level greater than 2 ng/ml. No patient in either group died, and no patient declared disease free had sustained tumor recurrence. Nine (four euthyroid, five hypothyroid) had received additional (131)I between the original and current studies due to detectable Tg or imaging evidence of disease; with follow-up, all now had a negative rhTSH-stimulated whole-body scan and seven (three euthyroid, four hypothyroid) had a stimulated serum Tg less than 2 ng/ml.

Previous work has demonstrated that a subset of macrophages expresses a folate receptor (FR) that can mediate internalization of folate-linked molecules, including imaging and therapeutic agents. To characterize this subset, macrophages were collected from peritoneal cavities of mice injected with saline, thioglycolate, zymosan, heat-killed or live bacteria, and cell-surface markers that coexpress with FR were identified. Virtually no F4/80(+) peritoneal macrophages from saline-injected mice expressed FR, whereas numerous macrophages from mice injected with each inflammatory stimulus expressed FR. Examination of cell differentiation antigens that are up-regulated in FR(+) macrophages revealed markers characteristic of an activated state (CD80, CD86, Ly-6C/G), whereas macrophages lacking these activation markers expressed few or no FR. FR(+) macrophages also produced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and reactive oxygen species, and production of reactive oxygen species correlated linearly with expression of FR. Synovial macrophages collected from arthritic patients were found to bind and internalize folate-linked dyes. Moreover, a folate-linked radioimaging agent was shown to image inflamed joints of rheumatoid arthritic patients. These results suggest that FR constitutes a marker for macrophage activation and that FR(+) macrophages can be targeted with folate-linked drugs without promoting drug uptake by nonactivated macrophages.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Atorvastatin metabolite measurements as a diagnostic tool for statin-induced myopathy.  Myopathic complaints are common in the general population and are more frequent with increasing age. When myopathic symptoms arise in a patient treated with a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin), it is always a question of whether the symptoms are due to statin-induced myopathy (SIM) or not (non-SIM). Diagnosis of SIM is not as straightforward as previously thought, because the most commonly used biomarker, serum creatine kinase, shows low specificity and selectivity, except in serious cases of rhabdomyolysis. There is a definite need for a novel biomarker for SIM. Based on a previous study reporting an altered metabolic profile with increased systemic exposure to the suspected muscle-toxic metabolite atorvastatin lactone in patients with SIM compared with healthy controls, this study aimed to explore the use of atorvastatin metabolite measurements to diagnose muscular complaints during statin treatment as being either SIM or non-SIM. PATIENTS, SETTING, AND STUDY DESIGN: Fifty-three patients with self-reported myopathic symptoms during atorvastatin treatment were recruited from our outpatient clinic. The symptoms were clinically evaluated as being SIM or non-SIM, on the basis of atorvastatin re-challenge testing. Atorvastatin and its metabolites were measured at steady state in all patients and compared with the clinical evaluation to see if this could predict the outcome and hence be suitable as a diagnostic tool for SIM. This was an exploratory study to investigate the proportion of patients correctly diagnosed by different metabolite cut-off ratios. With a cut-off ratio set at 1.1 for the atorvastatin lactone to atorvastatin acid ratio, 15 of 28 SIM patients (sensitivity of 54%) and 20 of 24 non-SIM patients (specificity of 83%) were correctly diagnosed. This corresponds to a positive predictive value of 79% and a negative predictive value of 61% (p\u2009=\u20090.006). The present study confirms an altered metabolic pattern of atorvastatin in patients with SIM and substantiates a central role of the lactone forms of statins in future investigations of statin myotoxicity. The atorvastatin lactone to acid ratio seems to be a valuable supportive diagnostic tool with high specificity and moderate sensitivity, adding to ordinary clinical evaluations when diagnosing SIM.

During the 2007 malaria transmission season, 1008 Gambian children were individually randomized to receive SP plus amodiaquine (AQ), SP plus piperaquine (PQ) or dihydroartemisinin (DHA) plus PQ at monthly intervals on three occasions during the peak malaria transmission season. To determine the risk of side effects following drug administration, participants in each treatment group were visited at home three days after the start of each round of drug administration and a side effects questionnaire completed. To help establish whether adverse events were drug related, the same questionnaire was administered to 286 age matched control children recruited from adjacent villages. Morbidity was monitored throughout the malaria transmission season and study children were seen at the end of the malaria transmission season. All three treatment regimens showed good safety profiles. No severe adverse event related to IPT was reported. The most frequent adverse events reported were coughing, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain and loss of appetite. Cough was present in 15.2%, 15.4% and 18.7% of study subjects who received SP plus AQ, DHA plus PQ or SP plus PQ respectively, compared to 19.2% in a control group. The incidence of malaria in the DHA plus PQ, SP plus AQ and SP plus PQ groups were 0.10 cases per child year (95% CI: 0.05, 0.22), 0.06 (95% CI: 0.022, 0.16) and 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.15) respectively. The incidence of malaria in the control group was 0.79 cases per child year (0.58, 1.08). All the three regimens of IPT in children were safe and highly efficacious ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00561899.

The intensity of bone remodeling is a critical determinant of the decay of cortical and trabecular microstructure after menopause. Denosumab suppresses remodeling more than alendronate, leading to greater gains in areal bone mineral density (aBMD). These greater gains may reflect differing effects of each drug on bone microarchitecture and strength. In a phase 2 double-blind pilot study, 247 postmenopausal women were randomized to denosumab (60 mg subcutaneous 6 monthly), alendronate (70 mg oral weekly), or placebo for 12 months. All received daily calcium and vitamin D. Morphologic changes were assessed using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) at the distal radius and distal tibia and QCT at the distal radius. Denosumab decreased serum C-telopeptide more rapidly and markedly than alendronate. In the placebo arm, total, cortical, and trabecular BMD and cortical thickness decreased (-2.1% to -0.8%) at the distal radius after 12 months. Alendronate prevented the decline (-0.6% to 2.4%, p = .051 to <.001 versus placebo), whereas denosumab prevented the decline or improved these variables (0.3% to 3.4%, p < .001 versus placebo). Changes in total and cortical BMD were greater with denosumab than with alendronate (p < or = .024). Similar changes in these parameters were observed at the tibia. The polar moment of inertia also increased more in the denosumab than alendronate or placebo groups (p < .001). Adverse events did not differ by group. These data suggest that structural decay owing to bone remodeling and progression of bone fragility may be prevented more effectively with denosumab.

In cirrhosis, hepatic endothelial dysfunction as a result of oxidative stress contributes to the postprandial increase in hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG). We aimed at testing the hypothesis that dark chocolate, which holds potent antioxidant properties, might attenuate the postprandial increase in HVPG in patients with cirrhosis. In this phase 2, double-blind, controlled study, 22 cirrhotic patients referred for HVPG measurement were included and randomly assigned to receive a liquid meal containing either dark chocolate (active treatment; 85% cocoa, 0.55 g/kg body wt; n = 11) or isocaloric amounts of white chocolate (devoid of cocoa flavonoids; control subjects; n = 11). HVPG, arterial pressure, portal blood flow, serum flavonoids (catechin and epicatechin), and nitric oxide were measured at baseline and 30 min after meal administration. The main outcome measure was the change in HVPG 30 min after the test meal. Postprandial hyperemia was accompanied by a marked increase in HVPG in the white-chocolate group (16.0 \u00b1 4.7-19.7 \u00b1 4.1 mm Hg or +26.4 \u00b1 12.7%; P < 0.0001), whereas the postprandial increase in HVPG was markedly attenuated in the dark-chocolate group (16.9 \u00b1 2.9-18.7 \u00b1 3.5 mm Hg or +11.5 \u00b1 15.9%; P = 0.02 compared with white chocolate). Portal blood flow increased similarly after meals containing dark or white chocolate (median increase: 32% compared with 39%). Plasma flavonoids increased 15-50-fold after dark chocolate consumption.

Fifty-nine mechanically ventilated patients within 2 hrs after elective cardiac surgery without preexisting lung diseases. Patients received a standard suctioning procedure with disconnection of the ventilator (20 secs, 14 F catheter, 200 cm H2O negative pressure). Prospectively, patients were stratified into two groups by the postsuctioning functional residual capacity value (group A: functional residual capacity >94% of baseline; group B: functional residual capacity <94% of baseline). Both groups were randomized into either a recruitment maneuver (RM) group (positive end-expiratory pressure 15 cm H2O, peak inspiratory pressure 35-40 cm H2O for 30 secs, group RM) or a non-RM group, in which ventilation was resumed without an RM (group NRM), resulting in four groups. Functional residual capacity and arterial blood gases were recorded for up to 1 hr. In addition, distribution of ventilation was measured by means of electrical impedance tomography. The RM had an impact on distribution of ventilation, functional residual capacity, and oxygenation in patients with a decrease of functional residual capacity after suctioning. In contrast, the RM showed no impact on these parameters in patients with no decrease of functional residual capacity after suctioning. By measurements of functional residual capacity after endotracheal suctioning, patients profiting from a consecutive recruitment maneuver could be identified.

Animal studies demonstrate that oral intake of DHA reduces Alzheimer-like brain pathology. To determine if supplementation with DHA slows cognitive and functional decline in individuals with Alzheimer disease. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of DHA supplementation in individuals with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (Mini-Mental State Examination scores, 14-26) was conducted between November 2007 and May 2009 at 51 US clinical research sites of the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study. Participants were randomly assigned to algal DHA at a dose of 2 g/d or to identical placebo (60% were assigned to DHA and 40% were assigned to placebo). Duration of treatment was 18 months. Change in the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) and change in the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) sum of boxes.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important pathogen causing annual epidemics of bronchiolitis and pneumonia among infants worldwide. High-risk infants currently receive RSV prophylaxis with palivizumab, a humanized RSV monoclonal antibody (MAb). In preclinical in vitro and in vivo (cotton-rat model) studies, motavizumab, a new RSV MAb, was shown to have greater anti-RSV activity than palivizumab. Motavizumab is currently under review for licensing approval. Since both MAbs may be available concurrently, this study evaluated their safety and tolerability when administered sequentially during the same RSV season. Between April 2006 and May 2006, 260 high-risk infants were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive monthly intramuscular injections: 2 doses of motavizumab followed by 3 doses of palivizumab (M/P); 2 doses of palivizumab followed by 3 doses of motavizumab (P/M); or 5 doses of motavizumab (control). Adverse events (AEs, serious AEs [SAEs]), development of antidrug antibody (ADA), and serum drug trough concentrations were assessed. Most children received all 5 doses (246/260 [94.6%]) and completed the study (241/260 [92.7%]). While overall AE rates were similar (mostly level 1 or 2 in severity), SAEs and level 3 AEs occurred more frequently in the M/P group (SAEs: 22.9% M/P, 8.4% P/M, 11.8% motavizumab only; level 3 AEs: 15.7% M/P, 6.0% P/M, 6.5% motavizumab only). This trend in AE rates occurred before and after switching from motavizumab to palivizumab, suggesting a cause other than the combined regimen. Frequencies of AEs judged by the investigator to be related to study drug were similar among groups. Two deaths occurred on study (both in the M/P group, before palivizumab administration); neither was considered by the site investigator to be related to study drug. Mean serum drug trough concentrations were comparable among groups; ADA detection was infrequent (5.1% or less of any group). The conclusions drawn from this study are limited by the small sample size per group. However, within this small study, overall AE rates, serum drug trough concentrations, and development of ADA associated with administering motavizumab and palivizumab sequentially to high-risk children appear comparable to administering motavizumab alone during the same RSV season. clinicaltrials.gov NCT00316264.

This study evaluated the intramuscular administration of an MMR vaccine (M-M-RvaxPro) and a varicella vaccine (VARIVAX) compared with the subcutaneous route. An open-label randomised trial was performed in France and Germany. Healthy children, aged 12 to 18 months, received single injections of M-M-RvaxPro and VARIVAX concomitantly at separate injection sites. Both vaccines were administered either intramuscularly (IM group, n = 374) or subcutaneously (SC group, n = 378). Immunogenicity was assessed before vaccination and 42 days after vaccination. Injection-site erythema, swelling and pain were recorded from days 0 to 4 after vaccination. Body temperature was monitored daily between 0 and 42 days after vaccination. Other adverse events were recorded up to 42 days after vaccination and serious adverse events until the second study visit. Antibody response rates at day 42 in the per-protocol set of children initially seronegative to measles, mumps, rubella or varicella were similar between the IM and SC groups for all four antigens.

This study therefore aimed to assess the immunogenicity and tolerability of a prepandemic (H5N1) influenza vaccine adjuvanted with AS03A in Japanese adults. This open-label, single-group study was conducted at two centres in Japan in healthy Japanese males and females aged 20-64 years (n = 100). Subjects received two doses of vaccine, containing 3.75 \u03bcg haemagglutinin of the A/Indonesia/5/2005-like IBCDC-RG2 Clade 2.1 (H5N1) strain adjuvanted with AS03A, 21 days apart. The primary endpoint evaluated the humoral immune response in terms of H5N1 haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titres against the vaccine strain (Clade 2.1) 21 days after the second dose. Ninety five percent confidence intervals for geometric mean titres, seroprotection, seroconversion and seropositivity rates were calculated. Secondary and exploratory endpoints included the assessment of the humoral response in terms of neutralising antibody titres, the response against additional H5N1 strains (Clade 1 and Clade 2.2), as well as the evaluation of safety and reactogenicity. Robust immune responses were elicited after two doses of the prepandemic influenza vaccine adjuvanted with AS03A.

A marked post-vaccination response in terms of neutralising antibody titres was demonstrated and persistence of the immune response was observed 6 months after the first dose. The vaccine was generally well tolerated and there were no serious adverse events reported. The H5N1 candidate vaccine adjuvanted with AS03A elicited a strong and persistent immune response against the vaccine strain A/Indonesia/5/2005 in Japanese adults.

A 24-week phase II trial has shown that 0.3 mg of laquinimod given daily to patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis was well tolerated and reduced the formation of active lesions. We assessed the effect of oral daily 0.3 and 0.6 mg laquinimod on MRI-monitored disease activity in a 36-week double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIb study. The study was done in 51 centres in nine countries. Inclusion criteria were one or more relapses in the year before entry and at least one gadolinium enhancing (GdE) lesion on screening MRI. Of 720 patients screened, 306 eligible patients were enrolled. Patients, aged 18-50 years, were randomly assigned to placebo (n=102), laquinimod 0.3 mg a day (n=98), or 0.6 mg a day (n=106). Brain MRI scans and clinical assessments were done at week -4, baseline, and monthly from week 12 to week 36. The primary outcome was the cumulative number of GdE lesions at weeks 24, 28, 32, and 36. The principal analysis of the primary endpoint was done on the intention-to-treat cohort. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00349193. Compared with placebo, treatment with laquinimod 0.6 mg per day showed a 40.4% reduction of the baseline adjusted mean cumulative number of GdE lesions per scan on the last four scans (simple means 4.2 [SD 9.2] vs 2.6 [5.3], p=0.0048); treatment with 0.3 mg per day showed no significant effects (3.9 [5.5] vs placebo, p=0.6740). Both doses of laquinimod were well tolerated, with some transient and dose-dependent increases in liver enzymes. A case of Budd-Chiari syndrome-ie, a thrombotic venous outflow obstruction of the liver-occurred after 1 month of exposure in a patient with underlying hypercoagulability who received 0.6 mg laquinimod. Anticoagulant treatment resulted in a decline of liver enzymes to normal without any clinical signs of hepatic decompensation.

Subjects scheduled for routine cataract surgery and with normal-appearing conjunctiva were eligible. One conjunctival biopsy sample and 1 aqueous humor sample were obtained from subjects randomly assigned to 1 of 10 prespecified time points (1 to 312 hours) after treatment initiation of azithromycin ophthalmic solution 1% or moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5%. Samples were assayed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Azithromycin 1% provided high concentrations (peak level, 559.7 \u03bcg/g) in human conjunctiva that were sustained at levels 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of moxifloxacin 0.5% throughout the 7-day dosing period and for at least 7 days thereafter. Azithromycin also showed an extended half-life (65.7 hours) in conjunctiva relative to that of moxifloxacin (28.6 hours). Accordingly, the concentration of azithromycin was maintained well above the minimum inhibitory concentration required for inhibition of growth of 90% of tested bacterial isolates for at least 7 days, whereas moxifloxacin conjunctival levels fell to levels at or less than the minimum inhibitory concentration required for inhibition of growth of 90% of tested bacterial isolates approximately 24 hours after the last dose. Peak aqueous humor concentration of moxifloxacin was higher (0.77 \u03bcg/mL) than that of azithromycin (0.053 \u03bcg/mL). No clinically relevant safety findings were observed. Azithromycin 1% demonstrated high, therapeutic levels in the conjunctiva that were maintained up to 7 days after completion of a 1-week dosing regimen.

This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00778323. Forty adult cervical spondylotic myelopathy patients undergoing elective decompression surgery were randomly assigned to either the RIPC group (n=20) or the control group (n=20). Limb RIPC consisted of three 5-minutes cycles of upper right limb ischemia with intervening 5-minute periods of reperfusion. Neuron-specific enolase and S-100B levels were measured in serum at set time points. Median nerve somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) were also recorded. Neurologic recovery rate was evaluated using a Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale. RIPC significantly reduced serum S-100B release at 6 hours and 1 day after surgery, and reduced neuron-specific enolase release at 6 hours, and then at 1, 3, and 5 days after surgery. No differences were observed in SEP measurements or the incidence of SEP changes during surgery between the control and RIPC groups. Recovery rate at 7 days, and at 1 and 3 months after surgery was higher in the RIPC group than in the control group (P<0.05). Our results for markers of neuronal ischemic injury and rate of recovery suggest that a clinical trial with sufficient statistical power to detect an effect of RIPC on the incidence of neurologic complications (paresis, palsy, etc) due to spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury after spine surgery is warranted [corrected].

The treatment was well tolerated. The results of this 30-week study suggest that PS-Omega3 may reduce ADHD symptoms in children. Preliminary analysis suggests that this treatment may be especially effective in a subgroup of hyperactive-impulsive, emotionally and behaviorally-dysregulated ADHD children.

Of 341 adolescents screened, 66 (70% African American) entered the study for 3 months of treatment. Assessment occurred at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks. ABFT consisted of individual and family meetings, and EUC consisted of a facilitated referral to other providers. All participants received weekly monitoring and access to a 24-hour crisis phone. Trajectory of change and clinical recovery were measured for suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms. Using intent to treat, patients in ABFT demonstrated significantly greater rates of change on self-reported suicidal ideation at post-treatment evaluation, and benefits were maintained at follow-up, with a strong overall effect size (ES = 0.97). Between-group differences were similar on clinician ratings. Significantly more patients in ABFT met criteria for clinical recovery on suicidal ideation post-treatment (87%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 74.6-99.6) than patients in EUC (51.7%; 95% CI = 32.4-54.32).

We describe the study design and methods used in a 9-month pedometer-based worksite intervention called \"ASUKI Step\" conducted at the Karolinska Institutet (KI) in Stockholm, Sweden and Arizona State University (ASU) in the greater Phoenix area, Arizona. \"ASUKI Step\" was based on the theory of social support and a quasi-experimental design was used for evaluation. Participants included 2,118 faculty, staff, and graduate students from ASU (n\u2009=\u2009712) and KI (n\u2009=\u20091,406) who participated in teams of 3-4 persons. The intervention required participants to accumulate 10,000 steps each day for six months, with a 3-month follow-up period. Steps were recorded onto a study-specific website. Participants completed a website-delivered questionnaire four times to identify socio-demographic, health, psychosocial and environmental correlates of study participation. One person from each team at each university location was randomly selected to complete physical fitness testing to determine their anthropometric and cardiovascular health and to wear an accelerometer for one week. Study aims were: 1) to have a minimum of 400 employee participants from each university site reach a level of 10,000 steps per day on at least 100\u2009days (3.5\u2009months) during the trial period; 2) to have 70% of the employee participants from each university site maintain two or fewer inactive days per week, defined as a level of less than 3,000 steps per day; 3) to describe the socio-demographic, psychosocial, environmental and health-related determinants of success in the intervention; and 4) to evaluate the effects of a pedometer-based walking intervention in a university setting on changes in self-perceived health and stress level, sleep patterns, anthropometric measures and fitness.Incentives were given for compliance to the study protocol that included weekly raffles for participation prizes and a grand finale trip to Arizona or Sweden for teams with most days over 10,000 steps. \"ASUKI Step\" is designed to increase the number of days employees walk 10,000 steps and to reduce the number of days employees spend being inactive. The study also evaluates the intra- and interpersonal determinants for success in the intervention and in a sub-sample of the study, changes in physical fitness and body composition during the study.

Oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) is effective but has significant limitations. AZD0837, a new oral anticoagulant, is a prodrug converted to a selective and reversible direct thrombin inhibitor (AR-H067637). We report from a Phase II randomized, dose-guiding study (NCT00684307) to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of extended-release AZD0837 in patients with AF. Atrial fibrillation patients (n = 955) with > or =1 additional risk factor for stroke were randomized to receive AZD0837 (150, 300, or 450 mg once daily or 200 mg twice daily) or VKA (international normalized ratio 2-3, target 2.5) for 3-9 months. Approximately 30% of patients were na\u00efve to VKA treatment. Total bleeding events were similar or lower in all AZD0837 groups (5.3-14.7%, mean exposure 138-145 days) vs. VKA (14.5%, mean exposure 161 days), with fewer clinically relevant bleeding events on AZD0837 150 and 300 mg once daily. Adverse events were similar between treatment groups; with AZD0837, the most common were gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. diarrhoea, flatulence, or nausea). d-Dimer, used as a biomarker of thrombogenesis, decreased in all groups in VKA-na\u00efve subjects with treatment, whereas in VKA pre-treated patients, d-dimer levels started low and remained low in all groups. As expected, only a few strokes or systemic embolic events occurred. In the AZD0837 groups, mean S-creatinine increased by approximately 10% from baseline and returned to baseline following treatment cessation. The frequency of serum alanine aminotransferase > or =3x upper limit of normal was similar for AZD0837 and VKA. AZD0837 was generally well tolerated at all doses tested.

The current study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00399490) was a multicenter, phase II, open-label, multiple-dose extension of an earlier randomized clinical trial. All patients (N=281) received infusions of tanezumab 50\u03bcg/kg on Days 1 and 56 with subsequent doses administered at 8-week intervals (up to a total of eight infusions). The primary endpoint of this study was safety. Effectiveness evaluations included overall knee pain, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index subscales, and subject global assessment (SGA) of response to therapy on 0-100 point visual analog scales. Repeated administration of tanezumab resulted in a low incidence of treatment-related adverse events (AEs; 7.5%). The rate of serious AEs was also low (2.8%) with none considered treatment-related. Few AEs of abnormal peripheral sensation were reported; hypoesthesia was reported by nine patients (3.2%), paresthesia by seven patients (2.5%), and hyperesthesia, peripheral neuropathy, and sensory disturbance were each reported by one patient (0.4% for each). Most AEs of abnormal peripheral sensation were rated as mild (95%) and the majority (65%) resolved before study completion. At Week 8, overall knee pain and SGA improved from baseline by a mean (\u00b1 standard error) of -12.8 (\u00b11.78) and 8.0 (\u00b11.66), respectively. Similar improvements occurred for WOMAC subscales. Repeated injections of tanezumab in patients with moderate to severe knee OA provide continued pain relief and improved function with a low incidence of side effects. Additional studies to define the efficacy and duration of pain reduction and to provide a more complete assessment of long-term safety are warranted.

Most cases of hepatocellular carcinoma occur in the Asia-Pacific region, where chronic hepatitis B infection is an important aetiological factor. Assessing the efficacy and safety of new therapeutic options in an Asia-Pacific population is thus important. We did a multinational phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of sorafenib in patients from the Asia-Pacific region with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) hepatocellular carcinoma. Between Sept 20, 2005, and Jan 31, 2007, patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who had not received previous systemic therapy and had Child-Pugh liver function class A, were randomly assigned to receive either oral sorafenib (400 mg) or placebo twice daily in 6-week cycles, with efficacy measured at the end of each 6-week period. Eligible patients were stratified by the presence or absence of macroscopic vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread (or both), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and geographical region. Randomisation was done centrally and in a 2:1 ratio by means of an interactive voice-response system. There was no predefined primary endpoint; overall survival, time to progression (TTP), time to symptomatic progression (TTSP), disease control rate (DCR), and safety were assessed. Efficacy analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00492752. 271 patients from 23 centres in China, South Korea, and Taiwan were enrolled in the study. Of these, 226 patients were randomly assigned to the experimental group (n=150) or to the placebo group (n=76). Median overall survival was 6.5 months (95% CI 5.56-7.56) in patients treated with sorafenib, compared with 4.2 months (3.75-5.46) in those who received placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.68 [95% CI 0.50-0.93]; p=0.014). Median TTP was 2.8 months (2.63-3.58) in the sorafenib group compared with 1.4 months (1.35-1.55) in the placebo group (HR 0.57 [0.42-0.79]; p=0.0005). The most frequently reported grade 3/4 drug-related adverse events in the 149 assessable patients treated with sorafenib were hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR; 16 patients [10.7%]), diarrhoea (nine patients [6.0%]), and fatigue (five patients [3.4%]). The most common adverse events resulting in dose reductions were HFSR (17 patients [11.4%]) and diarrhoea (11 patients [7.4%]); these adverse events rarely led to discontinuation. Sorafenib is effective for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in patients from the Asia-Pacific region, and is well tolerated.

After the third vaccination, the GMCs were 14.59 \u03bcg/mL and 12.15 \u03bcg/mL in the LBVH0101 and Hiberix\u2122 recipients, respectively. The booster dose produced higher antibody concentrations: 30.25 \u03bcg/mL and 71.64 \u03bcg/mL for LBVH0101 and Hiberix\u2122 recipients, respectively. Bactericidal capacity and antibody potency of anti-PRP IgG induced by LBVH0101 was 35.05 and 116.27 after the second and third vaccinations, respectively, compared with 53.76 and 79.64 for Hiberix\u2122. Anti-PRP IgG seroprotection rate and GMC were similar post-primary immunization between the groups; both showed functional maturation and similar booster responses. LBVH0101 had comparable safety results as the control vaccine, Hiberix\u2122, as most of the solicited adverse events and unsolicited adverse events upon LBVH0101 administration were mild in severity. No serious vaccination-related adverse reactions were observed. LBVH0101 showed a good immunogenicity and safety profile in infants and children.

In this randomized, controlled study we compared the immunogenicity and safety of an MF59(\u00ae)-adjuvanted (Novartis Vaccines, Marburg, Germany) A/H5N1 pre-pandemic vaccine with that of a licensed, MF59-adjuvanted, seasonal influenza vaccine. Healthy adult (18-60 years, n=3372) and elderly (\u226561 years, n=275) volunteers received either an initial dose of a licensed, non-adjuvanted, trivalent, seasonal influenza vaccine (Agrippal(\u00ae)) on Day 1, followed by one dose of MF59-H5N1 study vaccine on Day 22 and a second dose of MF59-H5N1 on Day 43, or alternatively, placebo on Day 1 followed by one dose of MF59-adjuvanted seasonal reference vaccine on Day 22 and a second dose of reference vaccine on Day 43. Homologous and cross-reactive A/H5N1 antibody responses were analysed by haemagglutination inhibition (HI), single radial haemolysis (SRH), and microneutralization (MN) assays three weeks after each vaccination. Vaccine safety was assessed throughout the study. Analysis by HI assay found that two doses of MF59-H5N1 resulted in a seroconversion rate of 56% and a geometric mean ratio (GMR) of 7.1 in adult subjects. Similar results were observed on analysis by SRH (GMR 4.03; seroconversion 78% and seroprotection 91%) and MN (seroconversion 67%) assays. These data met the European licensure criteria for influenza vaccines. No significant difference in immunogenicity was detected between the adult and elderly populations. Anti-A/H5N1 cross-clade antibodies were detected by SRH, 49% of adult and 32% of elderly subjects achieved seroconversion after the second vaccine dose. Overall, MF59-H5N1 containing 7.5\u03bcg antigen was less reactogenic than the MF59-adjuvanted trivalent seasonal vaccine which contained 15\u03bcg antigen for each component strain. Two doses of MF59-H5N1 vaccine were well tolerated and induced adequate levels of seroprotection against homologous and cross-clade A/H5N1 virus.

We assessed the effect of prophylactic administration of paracetamol at vaccination on infant febrile reaction rates and vaccine responses. In two consecutive (primary and booster) randomised, controlled, open-label vaccination studies, 459 healthy infants were enrolled from ten centres in the Czech Republic. Infants were randomly assigned with a computer-generated randomisation list to receive three prophylactic paracetamol doses every 6-8 h in the first 24 h (n=226) or no prophylactic paracetamol (n=233) after each vaccination with a ten-valent pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D-conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) co-administered with the hexavalent diphtheria-tetanus-3-component acellular pertussis-hepatitis B-inactivated poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3-H influenzae type b (DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib) and oral human rotavirus vaccines.

Compared with responses with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (rise in RPF approximately 95 mL x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2)), greater renal vasodilation with angiotensin receptor blockers (approximately 145 mL x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2)) suggested more effective blockade. We predicted that blockade with the direct oral renin inhibitor aliskiren would produce renal vascular responses exceeding those induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Twenty healthy normotensive subjects were studied on a low-sodium (10 mmol/d) diet, receiving separate escalating doses of aliskiren. Six additional subjects received captopril 25 mg as a low-sodium comparison and also received aliskiren on a high-sodium (200 mmol/d) diet. RPF was measured by clearance of para-aminohippurate. Aliskiren induced a remarkable dose-related renal vasodilation in low-sodium balance. The RPF response was maximal at the 600-mg dose (197+/-27 mL x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2)) and exceeded responses to captopril (92+/-20 mL x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2); P<0.01). Furthermore, significant residual vasodilation was observed 48 hours after each dose (P<0.01). The RPF response on a high-sodium diet was also higher than expected (47+/-17 mL x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2)). Plasma renin activity and angiotensin levels were reduced in a dose-related manner. As another functional index of the effect of aliskiren, we found significant natriuresis on both diets. Renal vasodilation in healthy people with the potent renin inhibitor aliskiren exceeded responses seen previously with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. The effects were longer lasting and were associated with significant natriuresis.

Data were analysed for both the Full Analysis (FA) population and the Per Protocol (PP) population (55 treated with OC000459 and 52 with placebo), which excluded non-compliant subjects. In the FA population, the mean change in FEV(1) was 7.1% on OC000459 compared with 4.3% on placebo (not significant); in the PP population, the mean changes were 9.2% and 1.8%, respectively (P=0.037). Improvement in quality of life was apparent in both FA and PP populations [difference from the placebo in AQLQ(S) total score of 0.29, P=0.0113 and 0.37, P=0.0022, respectively]. OC000459 also improved the night-time symptom scores (mean reduction of 0.36 vs. 0.11, P=0.008, FA population; 0.37 vs. 0.12, P=0.022, PP population). The geometric mean sputum eosinophil count reduced from 2.1% to 0.7% (P=0.03) after OC000459, but this effect was not significant when compared with the change on placebo (P=0.37). Adverse events on OC000459 were comparable to those on placebo; respiratory infections were notably less common during OC000459 than the placebo treatment. This study provides the first clinical evidence that CRTH2 receptors contribute to airflow limitation, symptoms and eosinophilic airway inflammation in asthma. OC000459 shows promise as a novel oral treatment for asthma and related disorders.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Addressing methodological challenges in implementing the nursing home pain management algorithm randomized controlled trial.  Unrelieved pain among nursing home (NH) residents is a well-documented problem. Attempts have been made to enhance pain management for older adults, including those in NHs. Several evidence-based clinical guidelines have been published to assist providers in assessing and managing acute and chronic pain in older adults. Despite the proliferation and dissemination of these practice guidelines, research has shown that intensive systems-level implementation strategies are necessary to change clinical practice and patient outcomes within a health-care setting. One promising approach is the embedding of guidelines into explicit protocols and algorithms to enhance decision making. The goal of the article is to describe several issues that arose in the design and conduct of a study that compared the effectiveness of pain management algorithms coupled with a comprehensive adoption program versus the effectiveness of education alone in improving evidence-based pain assessment and management practices, decreasing pain and depressive symptoms, and enhancing mobility among NH residents. The study used a cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) design in which the individual NH was the unit of randomization. The Roger's Diffusion of Innovations theory provided the framework for the intervention. Outcome measures were surrogate-reported usual pain, self-reported usual and worst pain, and self-reported pain-related interference with activities, depression, and mobility. The final sample consisted of 485 NH residents from 27 NHs. The investigators were able to use a staggered enrollment strategy to recruit and retain facilities. The adaptive randomization procedures were successful in balancing intervention and control sites on key NH characteristics. Several strategies were successfully implemented to enhance the adoption of the algorithm. LIMITATIONS/LESSONS: The investigators encountered several methodological challenges that were inherent to both the design and implementation of the study. The most problematic issue concerned the measurement of outcomes in persons with moderate to severe cognitive impairment. It was difficult to identify valid, reliable, and sensitive outcome measures that could be applied to all NH residents regardless of the ability to self-report. Another challenge was the inability to incorporate advances in implementation science into the ongoing study Methodological challenges are inevitable in the conduct of an RCT. The need to optimize internal validity by adhering to the study protocol is compromised by the emergent logistical issues that arise during the course of the study.

In a randomized cross-over study, 13 patients with type 2 diabetes, 3 women and 10 men, were instructed to eat a Paleolithic diet based on lean meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, root vegetables, eggs and nuts; and a Diabetes diet designed in accordance with dietary guidelines during two consecutive 3-month periods. Outcome variables included changes in weight, waist circumference, serum lipids, C-reactive protein, blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), and areas under the curve for plasma glucose and plasma insulin in the 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. Dietary intake was evaluated by use of 4-day weighed food records. Study participants had on average a diabetes duration of 9 years, a mean HbA1c of 6,6% units by Mono-S standard and were usually treated with metformin alone (3 subjects) or metformin in combination with a sulfonylurea (3 subjects) or a thiazolidinedione (3 subjects). Mean average dose of metformin was 1031 mg per day.

Other secondary end points included the percentage of patients who had a response to treatment as assessed by daily self-ratings of global IBS symptoms and individual symptoms of bloating, abdominal pain, and stool consistency during the 4 weeks after treatment and during the entire 3 months of the study. Significantly more patients in the rifaximin group than in the placebo group had adequate relief of global IBS symptoms during the first 4 weeks after treatment (40.8% vs. 31.2%, P=0.01, in TARGET 1; 40.6% vs. 32.2%, P=0.03, in TARGET 2; 40.7% vs. 31.7%, P<0.001, in the two studies combined). Similarly, more patients in the rifaximin group than in the placebo group had adequate relief of bloating (39.5% vs. 28.7%, P=0.005, in TARGET 1; 41.0% vs. 31.9%, P=0.02, in TARGET 2; 40.2% vs. 30.3%, P<0.001, in the two studies combined). In addition, significantly more patients in the rifaximin group had a response to treatment as assessed by daily ratings of IBS symptoms, bloating, abdominal pain, and stool consistency. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups. Among patients who had IBS without constipation, treatment with rifaximin for 2 weeks provided significant relief of IBS symptoms, bloating, abdominal pain, and loose or watery stools.

Recurrent miscarriage (RM) is defined as the occurrence of three or more clinically detectable pregnancy losses in the first trimester. In most cases of RM, its aetiology remains unexplained. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a cytokine, and its receptor are expressed in placental tissue. To investigate the effectiveness of G-CSF in preventing embryo demise, we administered G-CSF to women with RM. A randomised controlled trial in women with RM treated with G-CSF or placebo was conducted in one private reproductive medicine clinic. Sixty-eight women with unexplained primary RM, all with at least four consecutive miscarriages and negative for all clinical investigations, were selected. Patients were randomized for s.c. treatment with G-CSF (n = 35) (1 microg/kg/day) starting on the sixth day after ovulation, or with placebo (n = 33). Patients were randomized using a computer-generated randomization number sequence. Pregnancy outcome (delivery of a healthy baby without major or minor malformations) was the primary outcome measure. RESULTS In the group treated with G-CSF, 29 out of 35 (82.8%) women delivered a healthy baby, whereas in the placebo group, this figure was only 16 out of 33 (48.5%) (P = 0.0061, odds ratio = 5.1; 95% confidence interval 1.5-18.4). Significantly higher beta-hCG levels were found in gestation weeks 5-9 in women treated with G-CSF versus placebo (P < 0.001). Our data show that G-CSF may be effective in the treatment of unexplained RM. However, further studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of this treatment in women with unexplained RM, refractory to conventional treatment.

Following approval from the Research Ethics Board and written informed consent, we conducted this open-label prospective cohort investigation. A convenience sample of 16 patients, who were scheduled for coronary bypass surgery, received oral gabapentin 600 mg as follows: 90 min prior to induction of anesthesia, following tracheal extubation, and then every eight hours for a total of four doses. Plasma gabapentin concentration, as well as pain and sedation scores, were documented. Plasma gabapentin concentrations were unaltered during CPB (31.9 +/- 12.7 mumol.L(-1) prior to CPB, 35.6 +/- 12.9 to 37.2 +/- 9.6 mumol.L(-1) during CPB). However, using the current protocol, drug accumulation (reflected by increased drug concentrations) was observed following the third (58.2 +/- 19.5 micromol.L(-1)) and the fourth (71.9 +/- 34.3 micromol.L(-1)) doses. Pain and sedation scores and opioid requirements were comparable with those found in other studies. Plasma gabapentin concentration is unaltered during CPB following preoperative administration. Drug accumulation following third and fourth postoperative doses suggests the need for therapeutic drug monitoring in future trials.

Using therapeutic agents with anti-inflammatory or neurotrophic effects may be beneficial for treating schizophrenia. One hundred healthy controls and 95 Han Chinese patients with schizophrenia were tested in this double-blind study. Their PANSS scores, plasma interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were measured before and after pharmacological treatment. Pretreatment, plasma levels of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 were significantly higher in patients with schizophrenia than in controls, but plasma BDNF levels were significantly lower. Patients were treated with the atypical antipsychotic risperidone (Risp) only or with Risp+ dextromethorphan (DM).

Study Design.\u2002 Cross-sectional correlation between psychological variables and disability. Methods.\u2002 One hundred twenty-three patients treated for chronic LBP in pain units within nine Spanish National Health Service Hospitals, in eight cities, were included in this study. Intensity of LBP and pain referred to the leg, disability, catastrophizing, anger, state anxiety, trait anxiety, and depression were assessed through previously validated questionnaires. The association of disability with these variables, as well as gender, age, academic level, work status, and use of antidepressants, was analyzed through linear regression models. Correlations between LBP, referred pain, disability, catastrophizing, anger, state anxiety, trait anxiety, and depression were significant, except for the ones between anger and LBP and between anger and referred pain. The multivariate regression model showed that when variations of trait anxiety were taken into account, the association of the other psychological variables with disability was no longer significant. The final model explained 49% of the variability of disability. Standardized coefficients were 0.452 for trait anxiety, 0.362 for intensity of LBP, 0.253 for failed back surgery, and -0.140 for higher academic level. Among Spanish chronic LBP patients treated at pain units, the correlation of catastrophizing, state anxiety, anger, and depression with disability ceases to be significant when variations of trait anxiety are taken into account. Further studies with LBP patients should determine whether anxiety trait mediates the effects of the other variables, explore its prognostic value, and assess the therapeutic effect of reducing it.

A multicentre, randomised, patient and evaluator-blinded, controlled study in 306 patients fulfilling American College of Rheumatology criteria for knee osteoarthritis, radiological grades II-III (Kellgren-Lawrence) and joint space width \u2265 2 mm. Patients received four cycles of five intra-articular HA or placebo injections with a follow-up of 6 months after the first and second cycles, and 1 year after the third and fourth cycles. Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) 2004 responder criteria were used to assess efficacy. The consumption of rescue medication was a secondary outcome. Adverse events were recorded for safety purposes. At the 40-month visit significantly more patients responded to HA compared with placebo (OARSI 2004, p=0.004). The number of responders to HA increased through the study, whereas those to placebo did not change. Significant differences were also found in favour of HA for each individual component of the OARSI 2004. No safety problems were recorded. The results of AMELIA offer pioneer evidence that repeated cycles of intra-articular injections of HA not only improve knee osteoarthritis symptoms during the in-between cycle period but also exert a marked carry-over effect for at least 1 year after the last cycle. In this respect, it is not possible to establish if this carry-over effect reflects true osteoarthritis remission or just a modification of the disease's natural course.

We aimed to test the efficacy and safety of oral rivaroxaban for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after total knee arthroplasty. In a randomised, double-blind, phase III study, 3148 patients undergoing knee arthroplasty received either oral rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily, beginning 6-8 h after surgery, or subcutaneous enoxaparin 30 mg every 12 h, starting 12-24 h after surgery. Patients had mandatory bilateral venography between days 11 and 15. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of any deep-vein thrombosis, non-fatal pulmonary embolism, or death from any cause up to day 17 after surgery. Efficacy was assessed as non-inferiority of rivaroxaban compared with enoxaparin in the per-protocol population (absolute non-inferiority limit -4%); if non-inferiority was shown, we assessed whether rivaroxaban had superior efficacy in the modified intention-to-treat population. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00362232.

Studies of haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have identified threshold doses of T cells below which severe GVHD is usually absent. However, little is known regarding optimal T-cell dosing as it relates to engraftment, immune reconstitution, and relapse. To begin to address this question, we developed a 2-step myeloablative approach to haploidentical HSCT in which 27 patients conditioned with total body irradiation (TBI) were given a fixed dose of donor T cells (HSCT step 1), followed by cyclophosphamide (CY) for T-cell tolerization. A CD34-selected HSC product (HSCT step 2) was infused after CY. A dose of 2 \u00d7 10(8)/kg of T cells resulted in consistent engraftment, immune reconstitution, and acceptable rates of GVHD. Cumulative incidences of grade III-IV GVHD, nonrelapse mortality (NRM), and relapse-related mortality were 7.4%, 22.2%, and 29.6%, respectively. With a follow-up of 28-56 months, the 3-year probability of overall survival for the whole cohort is 48% and 75% in patients without disease at HSCT. In the context of CY tolerization, a high, fixed dose of haploidentical T cells was associated with encouraging outcomes, especially in good-risk patients, and can serve as the basis for further exploration and optimization of this 2-step approach.

The primary aim of this study was to demonstrate that DTPw-HBV/Hib2.5 [Kft] was not inferior to the licensed DTPw-HBV/Hib (Tritanrix(tm)-HepB/Hiberix(tm)) vaccine or the DTPw-HBV/Hib2.5 vaccine, also containing a reduced amount of PRP, with respect to the immune response to the PRP antigen, when administered to healthy infants, according to the Expanded Programme for Immunization (EPI) schedule at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age. 299 healthy infants were randomised to receive either DTPw-HBV/Hib2.5 [Kft] DTPw-HBV/Hib2.5 or DTPw-HBV/Hib according to the 6-10-14 week EPI schedule. Blood samples were analysed prior to the first dose of study vaccine and one month after the third vaccine dose for the analysis of immune responses. Solicited local and general symptoms such as pain, redness and swelling at the injection site and drowsiness and fever, unsolicited symptoms (defined as any additional adverse event) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded up to 20 weeks of age. One month after the third vaccine dose, 100% of subjects receiving DTPw-HBV/Hib2.5 [Kft] or DTPw-HBV/Hib and 98.8% of subjects receiving DTPw-HBV/Hib2.5 vaccine had seroprotective levels of anti-PRP antibodies (defined as anti-PRP antibody concentration \u22650.15 \u03bcg/ml). Seroprotective antibody concentrations were attained in over 98.9% of subjects for diphtheria, tetanus and hepatitis B. The vaccine response rate to pertussis antigen was at least 97.8% in each group. Overall, the DTPw-HBV/Hib2.5 [Kft] vaccine was well tolerated in healthy infants; no SAEs were reported in any group. The DTPw-HBV/Hib2.5 [Kft] vaccine was immunogenic and well-tolerated when administered according to the EPI schedule to Indian infants. http://www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT00473668.

Nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-related mitochondrial toxicity has been suggested as a key factor in the induction of antiretroviral-related lipoatrophy. This study aimed to evaluate in vivo the effects of NRTI withdrawal on mitochondrial parameters and body fat distribution. A multicenter, prospective, randomized trial assessed the efficacy and tolerability of switching to lopinavir-ritonavir plus nevirapine (nevirapine group; n = 34), compared with lopinavir-ritonavir plus 2 NRTIs (control group; n = 33) in a group of human immunodeficiency virus-infected adults with virological suppression. A subset of 35 individuals (20 from the nevirapine group and 15 from the control group) were evaluated for changes in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to nuclear DNA ratio and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity after NRTI withdrawal. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans were used to objectively quantify fat redistribution over time. The nevirapine group experienced a progressive increase in mtDNA content (a 40% increase at week 48; P = .039 for comparison between groups) and in the COX activity (26% and 32% at weeks 24 and 48, respectively; P = .01 and P = .09 for comparison between groups, respectively). There were no statistically significant between-group differences in DEXA scans at week 48, although a higher fat increase in extremities was observed in the nevirapine group. No virologic failures occurred in either treatment arm. Switching to a nucleoside-sparing regimen of nevirapine and lopinavir-ritonavir maintained full antiviral efficacy and led to an improvement in mitochondrial parameters, which suggests a reversion of nucleoside-associated mitochondrial toxicity. Although DEXA scans performed during the study only revealed slight changes in fat redistribution, a longer follow-up period may show a positive correlation between reduced mitochondrial toxicity and a clinical improvement of lipodystrophy.

The possibility of ductal closure with only 1 or 2 doses of treatment was a secondary objective. Sixty-four very low birth weight patients with echocardiographically confirmed patent ductus arteriosus and respiratory distress were studied. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either oral (group O, n=32) or intravenous (group I, n=32) ibuprofen starting on the third day of life. After the first dose of treatment in both groups, echocardiographic evaluation was performed to determine the need for a second or third dose. The rate of ductal closure, adverse effects, complications, and the patient's clinical course were recorded. In each group, 24 (75%) patients were born after 28 weeks' gestation. The rate of ductal closure tended to increase in group O (84.3% vs 62.5%). Closure of the ductus was obtained after 1 or 2 doses of treatment in 19 (70.3%) of 27 patients in group O and 14 (70%) of 20 patients in group I. The adverse effects were increased in group I (31.2% vs 9.3%). There were no significant differences with respect to complications during the stay. Adverse effects were significantly fewer when closure was achieved after an incomplete course of treatment (23.1% vs 76.9%). In very low birth weight infants, the rate of early ductal closure with oral ibuprofen is at least as good as with the intravenous route.

In all, 64% (175/274) of the patients received pulsed-dose-rate (PDR) brachytherapy and 36% (99/274) received high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy. Prescribed reference dose for HDR brachytherapy was 32 Gy in eight fractions of 4 Gy, twice daily. Prescribed reference dose in PDR brachytherapy was 49.8 Gy in 83 consecutive fractions of 0.6 Gy each hour. Total treatment time was 3 to 4 days. The median follow-up time was 64 months (range, 9-110). The actuarial 5-year local recurrence free survival rate (5-year LRFS) was 97.7%. Comparing patients with an age <50 years (49/274) vs. \u226550 years (225/274), the 5-year LRFS resulted in 92.5% and 98.9% (exact p = 0.030; 99% confidence interval, 0.029-0.032), respectively. Antihormonal treatment (AHT) was not applied in 9% (24/274) of the study population.

The primary efficacy measure was mean change from baseline in pre-dose evening forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)). Other endpoints included morning and evening peak expiratory flow, and rescue/symptom-free 24 h periods. Each dose was significantly superior to placebo for the primary endpoint (p<0.001) with efficacy at least similar to that reported with fluticasone propionate. There was no dose-response relationship across the FF doses studied. Peak expiratory flow improved in all groups (p<0.001 vs placebo), and there were significant treatment effects on rescue/symptom-free 24 h periods with all active treatments. FF was generally well tolerated. The incidence of oral candidiasis was higher with FF 800 \u03bcg than placebo; pharmacokinetic and 24 h urinary cortisol analyses confirmed a higher systemic exposure of FF at this highest dose level. FF doses <800 \u03bcg have a favourable therapeutic index. The absence of an efficacy dose response suggests that 200 \u03bcg is an appropriate dose in patients with moderate persistent asthma.

We aimed to assess the differential effects of either rosiglitazone or metformin monotherapy on the aforementioned adipocytokines in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). One hundred T2DM patients (30 men, 70 women), with poor glycemic control (glycosylated hemoglobin >6.5%) while taking 850 mg of metformin daily, were enrolled. All participants were randomized to receive either adjunctive therapy with rosiglitazone (8 mg/d, n = 50) or the maximum dose (2550 mg/d) of metformin (MET group, n = 50). Anthropometric parameters, glycemic and lipid profile, high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP), insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index [HOMA-IR]), visfatin, ghrelin, and apelin were assessed at baseline and after 14 weeks of therapy. Both rosiglitazone and metformin led to similar, significant improvement in glycemic profile and apelin levels, whereas lipid parameters, fat mass, and visfatin remained almost unaffected (P > .05). Insulin resistance was significantly attenuated in both groups, but to a lesser degree in the MET group (P = .045). Rosiglitazone-treated patients experienced a significant decrease in hs-CRP and systolic blood pressure compared with baseline values and those of the MET group (P < .05). Besides, rosiglitazone treatment considerably increased plasma ghrelin (3.74 +/- 1.52 ng/mL) in comparison with either baseline (P = .034) or metformin monotherapy values (-2.23 +/- 1.87 ng/mL, P = .008). On the other hand, the MET group, rather than the rosiglitazone group, had decreased body mass index (-0.79 +/- 0.47 vs 0.56 kg/m(2), P = .009). The aforementioned changes in apelin and ghrelin were independently associated with HOMA-IR changes. Both rosiglitazone and metformin favorably changed glycemic indexes and apelin levels. The addition of rosiglitazone seemed to confer greater benefits in ghrelin, hs-CRP, systolic blood pressure, and HOMA-IR regulation than metformin monotherapy. Although these results reflect improvement in cardiovascular risk profile, the overall clinical importance of insulin sensitizers must be further assessed.

Eye symptoms frequently occur in patients with allergic rhinitis and are among the most bothersome symptoms. Intranasal steroids have been shown to reduce ocular symptoms associated with allergic nasal symptoms, even though they do not reach the eye. To elucidate a mechanism to explain these observations. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover experiment in 20 subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Nasal antigen challenge was performed consecutively for 3 days after 1 week of treatment with either placebo or fluticasone furoate nasal spray (FFNS). Subjects recorded their nasal and ocular symptoms, and nasal secretions were quantified. Nasal scrapings to quantify eosinophils were obtained before each antigen challenge. Nasal challenge with antigen led to sneezing, a nasonasal, and a nasal-ocular reflex. Priming in the number of sneezes, contralateral nasal secretion weights, and total eye symptoms were observed. Treatment with FFNS reduced sneezing, the nasonasal and nasal-ocular reflexes, and the amount of eosinophils in nasal secretions. We confirmed that a nasal-ocular reflex follows nasal challenge with allergen and that it can contribute to the ocular symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis. FFNS reduced eosinophil infiltration, priming, and ocular symptoms. Furthermore, our results support a mechanism by which control of eye symptoms can be achieved during nasal administration of an intranasal steroid in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis.

Microbiological eradication rates in the 144 microbiologically evaluable patients were 88.2% and 90.8% for the respective treatment groups (95% CI of the difference, -12.6% to 7.5%). Both study drugs were well tolerated, with but a minority of patients requiring premature discontinuation due to an adverse event (6% in the ceftobiprole group and 4% in the comparator group). The overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events was higher in the ceftobiprole group, primarily owing to differences in rates of self-limited nausea (7% vs. 2%) and vomiting (5% vs. 2%).

Participants were male and female smokers aged 18 to 75 years who were motivated to stop smoking; smoked \u226510 cigarettes/d, with no cumulative period of abstinence >3 months in the previous year; and who had no serious or unstable disease within the previous 6 months. Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive varenicline 1 mg or placebo, BID for 12 weeks, with a 12-week nontreatment follow-up. Brief smoking-cessation counseling was provided. The main outcome measures were carbon monoxide-confirmed continuous abstinence rate (CAR) at weeks 9 to 12 and weeks 9 to 24. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded for tolerability assessment. Overall, 588 subjects (varenicline, 390; placebo, 198) were randomized and treated.

Participants were evenly randomized to one of three treatment groups (0.3 mg, 0.625 mg, or matching placebo) and treated for up to 12 weeks. Subjective sleep quality also was assessed. Significantly greater reductions from baseline in the weekly mean frequency of awakenings resulting from hot flushes occurred for participants randomized to either synthetic conjugated estrogens-B dose relative to placebo (mean reductions, 3.55, P=.004, and 4.65, P<.001 for 0.3 mg and 0.625 mg, respectively). In addition, a significantly greater proportion of participants at either estrogen dose had complete elimination of nocturnal awakenings (36.5% for 0.3 mg, 34% for 0.625 mg compared with 9.8% for placebo; P \u2264.002) with a general finding of improved sleep based on actigraphy data. No differences were observed in measures of sleep quality or daytime sleepiness. In this symptomatic postmenopausal population of women experiencing sleep disruption resulting from nocturnal vasomotor symptoms, a daily dose of synthetic conjugated estrogens-B as low as 0.3 mg appears to be effective in treating nocturnal hot flushes that lead to unwanted awakenings.

Participants were 70 college students who reported low physical activity (83% women, 60% African American). Participants were randomly assigned to either the BMI condition or to an education-only (EO) condition. They completed measures of physical activity at baseline and 1-month follow-up. Those in the BMI condition reported more vigorous-intensity physical activity at a 1-month follow-up than those in the EO condition. The findings from this study provide preliminary support for the efficacy of a BMI designed to increase physical activity among college students.

Immunogenicity of 10-valent pneumococcal nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae protein d conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV), administered as 2-dose or 3-dose priming followed by a booster dose, has been described previously. The present study evaluated immunologic memory following PHiD-CV vaccination according to these vaccination schedules. A dose of PHiD-CV (to test anamnestic responses) was administered to 172 children at 36 to 46 months of age; 110 of them had previously been vaccinated with PHiD-CV according to 2 + 1 or 3 + 1 schedules (PHiD-CV [2 + 1] and PHiD-CV [3 + 1] groups) and 62 were unprimed age-matched controls. To measure immune responses before and 7 to 10 days after the PHiD-CV dose, 22F-inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) assay were used. Serotype-specific IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and OPA geometric mean titers increased substantially (from before to 7 to 10 days after the additional PHiD-CV dose) for all 10 vaccines and 2 cross-reactive serotypes (6A and 19A) in the children previously vaccinated with PHiD-CV, regardless of the vaccination schedule used. Antibody GMCs and OPA geometric mean titers after the administration of the PHiD-CV dose were markedly higher in both previously PHiD-CV-vaccinated groups than in the unprimed control group, clearly demonstrating prior induction of immunologic memory. Antiprotein D antibody GMCs had also increased substantially from before to 7 to 10 days after vaccination in all 3 groups, with higher antibody GMCs in the previously vaccinated groups than in the control group. PHiD-CV vaccination according to 2 + 1 or 3 + 1 schedules resulted in comparable anamnestic immune responses.

Anti-CD20 antibody treatment has shown clinical activity in relapsed NLPHL. In this phase 2 trial, we investigated rituximab in newly diagnosed stage IA NLPHL patients. Four weekly applications at 375 mg/m(2) were given. Among the 28 evaluable patients, overall response rate was 100%, 24 patients (85.7%) achieved complete remission, and 4 (14.3%) achieved partial remission. At a median follow-up of 43 months, overall survival was 100%; progression-free survival at 12, 24, and 36 months was 96.4%, 85.3%, and 81.4%, respectively. No grade 3 or 4 toxicity was observed. Although treatment results with rituximab appear inferior compared with radiotherapy and combined-modality approaches in early-stage patients, investigation of anti-CD20 antibody-based combinations in NLPHL is warranted.

The present report is the outcome of a \"proof of concept\" study to evaluate the efficacy of dietary methionine restriction (MR) in humans with metabolic syndrome. Twenty-six obese subjects (six male and 20 female) meeting criteria for metabolic syndrome were randomized to a diet restricted to 2 mg methionine/kg body weight per day and were provided capsules containing either placebo (n = 12) or 33 mg methionine/kg body weight per day (n = 14). Energy expenditure, body composition, insulin sensitivity, and biomarkers of metabolic syndrome were measured before and after 16 wk on the respective diets. Insulin sensitivity and biomarkers of metabolic syndrome improved comparably in both dietary groups. Rates of energy expenditure were unaffected by the diets, but dietary MR produced a significant increase in fat oxidation (MR, 12.1 \u00b1 6.0% increase; control, 8.1 \u00b1 3.3% decrease) and reduction in intrahepatic lipid content (MR liver/spleen attenuation ratio, 8.1 \u00b1 3.3% increase; control ratio, 2.2 \u00b1 2.1% increase) that was independent of the comparable reduction in weight and adiposity that occurred in both groups.

We conducted a phase 3, open-label, multicenter, noninferiority trial that included 1271 patients between 3 and 60 years of age from Asia (81.3%) or Africa (18.7%) with microscopically confirmed, uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Patients underwent randomization for treatment with a fixed-dose combination of 180 mg of pyronaridine and 60 mg of artesunate or with 250 mg of mefloquine plus 100 mg of artesunate. Doses were calculated according to body weight and administered once daily for 3 days. Pyronaridine-artesunate was noninferior to mefloquine plus artesunate for the primary outcome: adequate clinical and parasitologic response in the per-protocol population on day 28, corrected for reinfection with the use of polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) genotyping. For this outcome, efficacy in the group receiving pyronaridine-artesunate was 99.2% (743 of 749 patients; 95% confidence interval [CI], 98.3 to 99.7) and that in the group receiving mefloquine plus artesunate was 97.8% (360 of 368 patients; 95% CI, 95.8 to 99.1), with a treatment difference of 1.4 percentage points (95% CI, 0.0 to 3.5; P=0.05). In the intention-to-treat population, efficacy on day 42 in the group receiving pyronaridine-artesunate was 83.1% (705 of 848 patients; 95% CI, 80.4 to 85.6) and that in the group receiving mefloquine plus artesunate was 83.9% (355 of 423 patients; 95% CI, 80.1 to 87.3). In Cambodia, where there were 211 study patients, the median parasite clearance time was prolonged for both treatments: 64 hours versus 16.0 to 38.9 hours in other countries (P<0.001, on the basis of Kaplan-Meier estimates). Kaplan-Meier estimates of the recrudescence rate in the intention-to-treat population in Cambodia until day 42 were higher with pyronaridine-artesunate than with mefloquine plus artesunate (10.2% [95% CI, 5.4 to 18.6] vs. 0%; P=0.04 as calculated with the log-rank test), but similar for the other countries combined (4.7% [95% CI, 3.3 to 6.7] and 2.8% [95% CI, 1.5 to 5.3], respectively; P=0.24).

ZOSTAVAX(\u00ae) vaccine was developed to prevent HZ and PHN in individuals \u226550 years (y) of age, and its clinical efficacy and safety have been demonstrated. This phase 4, open-label, multicenter study was undertaken to assess the immunogenicity and safety of a single dose of ZOSTAVAX (refrigerator-stable formulation) given within 6 mo of its expiry date in individuals \u226550 y of age. The geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) from pre-vaccination to 4 weeks post-vaccination in varicella zoster virus (VZV) antibody titers was calculated. An acceptable antibody response was defined as a lower 95% confidence interval (CI) of GMFR > 1.4. Solicited and unsolicited injection-site reactions and systemic adverse events were recorded. The GMFR in VZV antibody titers was 3.1 (95% CI: 2.6, 3.8), satisfying the criterion for an acceptable VZV antibody response to ZOSTAVAX (minimum requirement: 1.4 GMFR).

Moreover, in comparison with baseline values, rituximab treatment significantly improved the stimulated whole saliva flow rate (P = 0.004) and several other variables (e.g., B cell and RF levels, unstimulated whole saliva flow rate, lacrimal gland function on the lissamine green test, MFI scores, Short Form 36 health survey scores, and VAS scores for sicca symptoms). One patient in the rituximab group developed mild serum sickness-like disease. These results indicate that rituximab is an effective and safe treatment strategy for patients with primary SS.

The aim of the study was to examine the 48 month outcome of treating recent-onset type 1 diabetic patients for 6 days with humanised CD3-antibody, ChAglyCD3. Eighty patients, aged 12-39 years, were recruited for a phase 2 multicentre trial and randomised to placebo (n=40) or ChAglyCD3 (n=40) treatment by a third party member; participants and care-givers were blinded. The change in insulin dose (U kg(-1)day(-1)) over 48 months was chosen as primary endpoint and compared in 31 placebo-and 33 ChAglyCD3-treated patients. Adverse events were followed in 35 and 38 patients, respectively. Treatment with ChAglyCD3 delayed the rise in insulin requirements of patients with recent-onset diabetes and reduced its amplitude over 48 months (+0.09 vs +0.32 U kg(-1)day(-1) in the placebo group). Using multivariate analysis this effect was correlated with higher baseline residual beta cell function and a younger age. It was associated with better outcome variables in subgroups selected according to these variables. In the ChAglyCD3 subgroup with higher initial beta cell function, 0/11 patients became C-peptide-negative over 48 months vs 4/9 in the corresponding placebo subgroup. In the subgroup aged <27 years old, antibody treatment preserved initial beta cell function for 36 months (vs >80% decline within 24 months in the placebo subgroup <27 years old), resulted in lower HbA1c concentrations and tended to reduce glycaemic variability (p=0.08). No longterm adverse events were observed. A 6 day ChAglyCD3 treatment can suppress the rise in insulin requirements of recent-onset type 1 diabetic patients over 48 months, depending on their age and initial residual beta cell function. In younger patients this effect is associated with reduced deterioration of metabolic variables. These observations help to define inclusion criteria for prevention trials.

This methodology was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, and this study is the first historical control design in epilepsy to complete enrollment. Patients \u226513 years old with uncontrolled partial epilepsy receiving monotherapy with valproate or a noninducing antiepileptic drug were converted to once-daily LTG XR (250 mg or 300 mg) as monotherapy and were followed up for 12 additional weeks.

Dexmedetomidine, a selective \u03b1(2) adrenoreceptor agonist, has analgesic and sedative properties, minimal impact on respiratory parameters, and reportedly decreases analgesic requirements after surgery. Given its pharmacodynamic profile, dexmedetomidine might have a role for postoperative pain control in children undergoing tonsillectomy. In this study, we hypothesized that dexmedetomidine would delay and decrease opioid requirements after tonsillectomy. In a double-blind controlled trial, participants undergoing tonsillectomy were randomized to receive one intravenous dose of fentanyl (1 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1) or 2 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1)) or dexmedetomidine (2 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1) or 4 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1)) immediately after endotracheal intubation. Primary outcomes included requirement for rescue morphine in the initial postoperative period. One hundred and one children were enrolled. During the postoperative period, dexmedetomidine (2 and 4 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1) groups combined) significantly prolonged the opioid-free interval of children who underwent tonsillectomy compared with fentanyl (1 and 2 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1) groups combined) (P < 0.001). Children treated with dexmedetomidine 2 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1) vs dexmedetomidine 4 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1) had similar cumulative incidence curves for time to morphine rescue, whereas there was a small difference in time to first morphine rescue administration when comparing fentanyl 1 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1) vs fentanyl 2 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1). Furthermore, length of stay in the postanesthesia care unit was significantly longer for children treated with dexmedetomidine vs children treated with fentanyl (P = 0.0016). High-dose dexmedetomidine decreases opioid requirements, prolongs the opioid-free interval after tonsillectomy, and prolongs length of stay in the postanesthesia care unit. It is conceivable that these early opioid-sparing effects could benefit patients at risk for respiratory complications early in the postoperative course after tonsillectomy (e.g., patients with obstructive sleep apnea).

However, due to a severe shortage of organ donors, surgical complications, transplant rejection and the high cost of this procedure much interest has focused on research to find new treatment modalities for this disease. There is accumulating evidence for the contribution of bone marrow stem cells to participate in liver regeneration.

The immunogenicity of both vaccines was evaluated according to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) criteria. This clinical trial was performed between April and December 2007 in Argentina. A total of 1893 subjects were stratified into three age groups (3-8\u2009y, 9-17\u2009y, and 18-64\u2009y), and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either Agrippal or Fluvirin. Adolescents and adults received one dose of vaccine intramuscularly, whereas children aged 3-8 years received two vaccine doses, administered 4\u2009wk apart. Antibody levels were measured by means of hemagglutination inhibition assay before vaccination (baseline); 21\u2009d after the first vaccination (adults and adolescents); and, for children aged 3-8\u2009y, 28\u2009d after the first vaccination and 21\u2009d after the second vaccine dose. Adverse reactions were solicited via diary cards for 7\u2009d after each vaccination, and unsolicited adverse events were reported throughout the study period. Both vaccines were safe and well-tolerated, and elicited robust immunogenic responses in all age groups, meeting both CBER licensure criteria for all three viral strains after completion of the age-recommended vaccination schedule. These findings support the use of the trivalent subunit influenza vaccines Agrippal and Fluvirin for universal vaccination campaigns on an annual basis. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00464672.

We investigated whether small and large particle sizes of aerosolised adenosine monophospate (AMP) provoke similar severity of AHR. Additionally, effects of the small-particle inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) ciclesonide and large-particle ICS fluticasone on AHR to large- and small-particle size AMP were assessed. After a 4-week run-in period using open-label fluticasone (100 \u03bcg b.i.d.), 37 mild-to-moderate asthmatics underwent provocations with standard-size (3.7 \u03bcm), large-particle (9.9 \u03bcm) and small-particle (1.06 \u03bcm) AMP. Subjects received 4-week ciclesonide (160 \u03bcg s.i.d.) or fluticasone (100 \u03bcg b.i.d.) treatment (double-blind and double-dummy) followed by large- and small-particle AMP provocation. Small-particle AMP induced a 20% decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) at a significantly higher dose than large-particle AMP. Ciclesonide and fluticasone had comparable effects on AMP provocations. Not all subjects reached the provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV(1) (PC(20)) at the highest AMP dose. In those who did, ciclesonide improved small-particle AMP PC(20) by 1.74 doubling doses (DD) (p = 0.03), whereas fluticasone did not. Conversely, fluticasone improved large-particle AMP PC(20) significantly (1.32 DD; p = 0.03), whereas ciclesonide did not. Small-particle AMP provocation appears to be a promising tool to assess changes in small airway inflammation. Future adjustments are necessary taking into account the very small particle size used, with large exhaled fractions. In asthmatics reaching a PC(20) with small- and large-particle AMP provocations, ciclesonide improves hyperresponsiveness to small particle size AMP, and fluticasone to large particle size.

We determined the effect of zinc as adjunct therapy on time to normalization of respiratory rate, temperature and oxygen saturation. We also studied the effect of zinc adjunct therapy on case fatality of severe childhood pneumonia (as a secondary outcome) in Mulago Hospital, Uganda. In this double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 352 children aged 6 to 59 months, with severe pneumonia were randomized to zinc (20 mg for children \u2265 12 months, and 10 mg for those < 12 months) or a placebo once daily for seven days, in addition to standard antibiotics for severe pneumonia. Children were assessed every six hours. Oxygen saturation was normal if it was above 92% (breathing room air) for more than 15 minutes. The respiratory rate was normal if it was consistently (more than 24 hours) below 50 breaths per minute in infants and 40 breaths per minute in children above 12 months of age. Temperature was normal if consistently below 37.5\u00b0C. The difference in case fatality was expressed by the risk ratio between the two groups. Time to normalization of the respiratory rate, temperature and oxygen saturation was not significantly different between the two arms.Case fatality was 7/176 (4.0%) in the zinc group and 21/176 (11.9%) in the placebo group: Relative Risk 0.33 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.76). Relative Risk Reduction was 0.67 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.85), while the number needed to treat was 13.

Individual malaria interventions provide only partial protection in most epidemiological situations. Thus, there is a need to investigate whether combining interventions provides added benefit in reducing mortality and morbidity from malaria. The potential benefits of combining IPT in children (IPTc) with home management of malaria (HMM) was investigated. During the 2008 malaria transmission season, 1,277 children under five years of age resident in villages within the rural Farafenni demographic surveillance system (DSS) in North Bank Region, The Gambia were randomized to receive monthly IPTc with a single dose of sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) plus three doses of amodiaquine (AQ) or SP and AQ placebos given by village health workers (VHWs) on three occasions during the months of September, October and November, in a double-blind trial. Children in all study villages who developed an acute febrile illness suggestive of malaria were treated by VHWs who had been taught how to manage malaria with artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem\u2122). The primary aims of the project were to determine whether IPTc added significant benefit to HMM and whether VHWs could effectively combine the delivery of both interventions. The incidence of clinical attacks of malaria was very low in both study groups. The incidence rate of malaria in children who received IPTc was 0.44 clinical attacks per 1,000 child months at risk while that for control children was 1.32 per 1,000 child months at risk, a protective efficacy of 66% (95% CI -23% to 96%; p = 0.35). The mean (standard deviation) haemoglobin concentration at the end of the malaria transmission season was similar in the two treatment groups: 10.2 (1.6) g/dL in the IPTc group compared to 10.3 (1.5) g/dL in the placebo group. Coverage with IPTc was high, with 94% of children receiving all three treatments during the study period. Due to the very low incidence of malaria, no firm conclusion can be drawn on the added benefit of IPTc in preventing clinical episodes of malaria among children who had access to HMM in The Gambia. However, the study showed that VHWs can successfully combine provision of HMM with provision of IPTc.

CTEPH is characterized by vascular obstruction and remodeling, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Although pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) is potentially curative, medical therapy is needed in patients with inoperable disease or persistent/recurrent pulmonary hypertension after PEA. The BENEFiT (Bosentan Effects in iNopErable Forms of chronIc Thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension) study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in CTEPH including patients with either inoperable CTEPH or persistent/recurrent pulmonary hypertension after PEA (>6 months after PEA).

After an acute myocardial infarction, the early restoration of coronary blood flow is mandatory for reducing infarct size.

Recent animal studies have suggested that erythropoietin could protect the myocardium when administered after the onset of reperfusion. We investigated whether the administration of erythropoietin at the time of PCI would limit the size of the infarct during acute myocardial infarction by analysis of MRI and cardiac enzymes in this pilot study. We randomly assigned 57 patients with acute, anterior wall ST-elevation myocardial infarction who were presented within 12h after the onset of chest pain to one group which was given an intravenous bolus of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO, 50 U/kg) immediately before undergoing PCI or the control group without the IV treatment before PCI. Infarct size was assessed by measuring the release of cardiac enzymes (CK, CK-MB) and by performing MRI on day 4 after infarction. The injection of erythropoietin did not result in thrombotic or hypertensive complications. The release of cardiac enzyme was not different between two groups. On day 4, the absolute infarct volume of the area of hyperenhancement on MRI did not differ between two groups (EPO group 52.4 \u00b1 23.6 cm(3) vs. control group 54.8 \u00b1 28.6 cm(3), p=0.74).

Patients completed symptom score cards twice daily. Lung function, including the incidence of new-onset or progressive bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, was recorded at Day 90. We enrolled 24 patients (ALN-RSV01, n = 16; placebo, n = 8); randomization was stratified by ribavirin use. ALN-RSV01 was well tolerated, with no drug-related serious adverse events or post-inhalation perturbations in lung function. Interpretation of viral measures was confounded by baseline differences between the two groups in viral load and time from symptom onset to first dose. Mean daily symptom scores were lower in subjects receiving ALN-RSV01, and the mean cumulative daily total symptom score was significantly lower with ALN-RSV01 (114.7 \u00b1 63.13 vs. 189.3 \u00b1 99.59, P = 0.035). At Day 90, incidence of new or progressive bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome was significantly reduced in ALN-RSV01 recipients compared with placebo (6.3% vs. 50%, P = 0.027).

Rostafuroxin lowered blood pressure (BP) in some animal models and in humans. OASIS-HT consisted of 5 concurrently running double-blind cross-over studies. After 4 weeks without treatment, 435 patients with uncomplicated systolic hypertension (140-169 mm Hg) were randomized to rostafuroxin (0.05, 0.15, 0.5, 1.5 or 5.0 mg/d) or matching placebo, each treatment period lasting 5 weeks. The primary endpoint was the reduction in systolic office BP. Among the secondary endpoints were diastolic office BP, 24-h ambulatory BP, plasma EO concentration and renin activity, 24-h urinary sodium and aldosterone excretion, and safety.

We aimed to assess the effect of umbilical-cord cleansing with 4% chlorhexidine (CHX) solution, with or without handwashing with antiseptic soap, on the incidence of omphalitis and neonatal mortality. We did a two-by-two factorial, cluster-randomised trial in Dadu, a rural area of Sindh province, Pakistan. Clusters were defined as the population covered by a functional traditional birth attendant (TBA), and were randomly allocated to one of four groups (groups A to D) with a computer-generated random number sequence. Implementation and data collection teams were masked to allocation. Liveborn infants delivered by participating TBAs who received birth kits were eligible for enrolment in the study. One intervention comprised birth kits containing 4% CHX solution for application to the cord at birth by TBAs and once daily by family members for up to 14 days along with soap and educational messages promoting handwashing. One intervention was CHX solution only and another was handwashing only. Standard dry cord care was promoted in the control group. The primary outcomes were incidence of neonatal omphalitis and neonatal mortality.

To test the hypothesis that high-dose multivitamin supplementation vs standard-dose multivitamin supplementation decreases the risk of HIV disease progression or death and improves immunological, virological, and nutritional parameters in patients with HIV initiating HAART. A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of high-dose vs standard-dose multivitamin supplementation for 24 months in 3418 patients with HIV initiating HAART between November 2006 and November 2008 in 7 clinics in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. INTERVENTION The provision of daily oral supplements of vitamin B complex, vitamin C, and vitamin E at high levels or standard levels of the recommended dietary allowance. The composite of HIV disease progression or death from any cause. The study was stopped early in March 2009 because of evidence of increased levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) in patients receiving the high-dose multivitamin supplement. At the time of stopping, 3418 patients were enrolled (median follow-up, 15 months), and there were 2374 HIV disease progression events and 453 observed deaths (2460 total combined events).

We aimed to determine the effect of n-3 PUFAs in addition to amiodarone and a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor on the maintenance of sinus rhythm after direct current cardioversion in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm trial in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation, with at least 1 relapse after cardioversion, and treated with amiodarone and a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor. Participants were assigned to placebo or n-3 PUFAs 2 g/d and then underwent direct current cardioversion 4 weeks later. The primary end point was the probability of maintenance of sinus rhythm at 1 year after cardioversion. Of 254 screened patients, 199 were found to be eligible and randomized. At the 1-year follow up, the probability of maintenance of sinus rhythm was significantly higher in the n-3 PUFAs-treated patients compared with the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.62 [95% confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.72] and 0.36 [95% confidence interval, 0.26 to 0.46], respectively; P=0.0001).

The aim was to undertake a study of GORD patients designed to approximate ordinary clinical practice that would identify patient characteristics predicting symptomatic response to pantoprazole treatment. 1888 patients with symptoms of GORD were enrolled in a multicentre, multinational, prospective, open study of 8 weeks pantoprazole treatment, 40 mg daily. Response was assessed by using the ReQuest\u2122 questionnaire, by the investigator making conventional clinical enquiry and by asking patients about their satisfaction with symptom control. Factors including pre-treatment oesophagitis, gender, age, body mass index (BMI), Helicobacter pylori status, anxiety and depression, and concurrent IBS symptoms were examined using logistic regression to determine if they were related to response, judged from the ReQuest\u2122-GI score. Poorer treatment responses were associated with non-erosive reflux disease, female gender, lower BMI, anxiety and concurrent irritable bowel syndrome symptoms before treatment. No association was found with age, Helicobacter pylori status or oesophagitis grade. Some reflux-related symptoms were still present in 14% of patients who declared themselves 'well-satisfied' with their symptom control. Some readily identifiable features help to predict symptomatic responses to a PPI and consequently may help in managing patient expectation. ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: NCT00312806.

Glucose metabolic status was defined as worsened when a progression from normoglycemia to impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or from IFG to diabetes occurred or when an increase of HbAlc by at least 0.5% was demonstrated. An improvement of glucose metabolism was defined in the presence of a regression from IFG to normoglycemia and/or when HbAlc decreased by at least 0.5%. Glucose metabolic status remained unchanged in a majority of patients (16/26 patients, 65.3%), worsened in six patients, and improved in four patients. Pre-existing metabolic status did not predict worsening of glucose metabolism, which, conversely, was significantly related to persistent biochemical activity of the disease. In fact, patients with worsened glucose metabolism exhibited a less frequent decrease in serum GH and IGF1 levels, compared with patients with improved or unchanged glucose metabolism (2/6 vs 18/20; P=0.01). An increase in octreotide LAR dose or frequency did not impact on glucose metabolism in most patients.

This report concerns the development and validation of two patient-reported outcomes questionnaires developed to assess chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients' ability to perform morning activities and to evaluate their morning symptoms. Based on interviews with COPD patients, the Capacity of Daily Living during the Morning (CDLM) questionnaire and the Global Chest Symptoms Questionnaire (GCSQ) were developed, linguistically validated and incorporated into two multicentre, randomised trials involving a total of 1,100 COPD patients; those trials were registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00496470 and NCT00542880). Data from these trials were used to determine the reliability, validity and responsiveness of the questionnaires and to derive estimates of minimal important differences (MIDs). Both questionnaires displayed good-to-high reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.75-0.93). Analysis of convergent validity showed that CDLM and GCSQ scores correlated significantly (p<0.001) with symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and use of rescue medication. In both trials, CDLM and GCSQ scores discriminated between patients with different levels of HRQoL, as assessed by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD patients (SGRQ-C), but not with disease severity, as assessed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria. A significant improvement in CDLM and GCSQ scores occurred in response to treatment. Estimations of MID scores, corresponding to an SGRQ-C MID of 4, were 0.20 for the CDLM questionnaire and 0.15 for the GCSQ.

This study aimed to assess efficacy and safety of insulin degludec injected once a day or three times a week compared with insulin glargine once a day in insulin-naive people with type 2 diabetes, who were inadequately controlled with oral antidiabetic drugs. In this 16-week, randomised, open-label, parallel-group phase 2 trial, participants aged 18\u201375 years with type 2 diabetes and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1C)) of 7\u00b70\u201311\u00b70% were enrolled and treated at 28 clinical sites in Canada, India, South Africa, and the USA. Participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1:1 ratio by computer-generated block randomisation to receive insulin degludec either once a day or three times a week or insulin glargine once a day, all in combination with metformin. Investigators were masked to data until database release. The primary outcome was HbA(1C) after 16 weeks of treatment. Analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00611884. Of 367 patients screened, 245 were eligible for inclusion. 62 participants were randomly allocated to receive insulin degludec three times a week (starting dose 20 U per injection [1 U=9 nmol]), 60 to receive insulin degludec once a day (starting dose 10 U [1 U=6 nmol]; group A), 61 to receive insulin degludec once a day (starting dose 10 U [1 U=9 nmol]; group B), and 62 to receive insulin glargine (starting dose 10 U [1 U=6 nmol]) once a day.

In this open-label randomised trial in Rarieda district of western Kenya, we enrolled school children (aged 6-15 years) who had Schistosoma mansoni infection according to duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears from a stool sample. Computer-generated block randomisation was used to assign children (1:1) to receive artesunate (100 mg) with sulfalene (also known as sulfamethoxypyrazine; 250 mg) plus pyrimethamine (12.5 mg) as one dose every 24 h for 3 days or one dose of praziquantel (40 mg/kg per day). The primary efficacy endpoint was the number of participants cured 28 days after treatment. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01054651. Between October and December, 2009, 212 children were enrolled and assigned to receive artesunate with sulfalene plus pyrimethamine (n=106) or praziquantel (n=106). 69 patients (65%) were cured in the praziquantel treatment group compared with 15 (14%) in the artesunate with sulfalene plus pyrimethamine treatment group (p<0.0001). Adverse events were less common in patients taking artesunate with sulfalene plus pyrimethamine than in those taking praziquantel (22% [n=23] vs 49% [n=52], p<0.0001), and no drug-related serious adverse events occurred. The standard treatment with praziquantel is more effective than artesunate with sulfalene plus pyrimethamine in the treatment of children with S mansoni infection in western Kenya. Whether artemisinin-based combination therapy has a role in the treatment of schistosomiasis is unclear.

The Increased Flow Utilizing Subcutaneously-Enabled (INFUSE)-Pediatric Rehydration Study was designed to assess efficacy, safety, and clinical utility of recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20)-facilitated subcutaneous rehydration in children 2 months to 10 years of age. Patients with mild/moderate dehydration requiring parenteral treatment in US emergency departments were eligible for this phase IV, multicenter, single-arm study. They received subcutaneous injection of 1 mL rHuPH20 (150 U), followed by subcutaneous infusion of 20 mL/kg isotonic fluid over the first hour. Subcutaneous rehydration was continued as needed for up to 72 hours. Rehydration was deemed successful if it was attributed by the investigator primarily to subcutaneous fluid infusion and the child was discharged without requiring an alternative method of rehydration. Efficacy was evaluated in 51 patients (mean age: 1.9 years; mean weight: 11.2 kg). Initial subcutaneous catheter placement was achieved with 1 attempt for 46/51 (90.2%) of patients. Rehydration was successful for 43/51 (84.3%) of patients. Five patients (9.8%) were hospitalized but deemed to be rehydrated primarily through subcutaneous therapy, for a total of 48/51 (94.1%) of patients. No treatment-related systemic adverse events were reported, but 1 serious adverse event occurred (cellulitis at infusion site). Investigators found the procedure easy to perform for 96% of patients (49/51 patients), and 90% of parents (43/48 parents) were satisfied or very satisfied. rHuPH20-facilitated subcutaneous hydration seems to be safe and effective for young children with mild/moderate dehydration.

To meet the regulatory requirements for approval of an antihypertensive treatment in Korea, this pair of studies was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of fimasartan, to determine its dose-response relationship and minimum effective dose, and to characterize its blood pressure (BP)-reduction profile over the dosing interval. These 2 Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, and dose-response studies enrolled male or nonchildbearing female Korean patients aged 18 to 65 years (study 1) or 18 to 70 years (study 2) with essential hypertension (sitting diastolic BP [DBP] 95-<115 mm Hg [study 1] or 90-<110 mm Hg [study 2]).

Increased age and female gender are well-known risk factors for the development of desmopressin-induced hyponatremia. However, little focus has been on exploring gender differences in the antidiuretic response to desmopressin. Based on an exploratory analysis from three clinical trials, we report a significant gender difference in the effects of desmopressin on nocturnal urine volume that could not be explained by pharmacokinetic differences. Mean desmopressin concentration profiles were tested for covariates, and age and gender were not statistically significant and only weight was significant for log(C(max)) (P = 0.0183) and borderline significant for log(AUC) (P = 0.0571). The decrease in nocturnal urine volume in nocturia patients treated with desmopressin over 28 days was significantly larger for women at the lower desmopressin melt doses of 10 and 25 \u03bcg than for men. The ED(50) for men was modeled to be 43.2 \u03bcg and 16.1 \u03bcg for women, with the ED(50) men/women estimated to be 2.7 (1.3-8.1 95% CI), corresponding to significantly higher sensitivity to desmopressin in women. An increasing incidence of hyponatremia with increasing dose was found, and at the highest dose level of 100 \u03bcg decreases in serum sodium were approximately twofold greater in women over 50 yr of age than in men. A new dose recommendation stratified by gender is suggested in the treatment of nocturia: for men, 50- to 100-\u03bcg melt is an efficacious and safe dose, while for women a dose of 25 \u03bcg melt is recommended as efficacious with no observed incidences of hyponatremia. Areas for further research are proposed to uncover pathophysiological mechanism(s) behind these gender differences.

This mutation is associated with hypermethylation at the FMR1 promoter and resultant transcriptional silencing. FMR1 silencing has many consequences, including up-regulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5)-mediated signaling. mGluR5 receptor antagonists have shown promise in preclinical FXS models and in one small open-label study of FXS. We examined whether a receptor subtype-selective inhibitor of mGluR5, AFQ056, improves the behavioral symptoms of FXS in a randomized, double-blind, two-treatment, two-period, crossover study of 30 male FXS patients aged 18 to 35 years.

Pain intensity was assessed using a numeric rating scale (NRS) from time 0 through to 72 hours postsurgically. The primary efficacy measure was area under the curve (AUC) of NRS scores through 24 hours. Other efficacy measures included AUC of NRS at other time points, proportion of patients who were pain-free, time to first opioid use, and total postsurgical consumption of supplemental opioid medication. Adverse events were also assessed. The AUC for NRS scores was significantly less in patients treated with DepoFoam bupivacaine versus patients receiving placebo at 24 hours (P = 0.0005) and 36 hours (P < 0.0229). More patients treated with DepoFoam bupivacaine avoided use of opioid rescue medication during the first 24 hours (7.2% vs. 1%; P < 0.0404) and were pain-free (NRS \u2264 1) at 2, 4, 8, and 48 hours. Median time-to-first-opioid use was delayed in favor of DepoFoam bupivacaine (4.3 vs. 7.2 hours; P < 0.0001). Fewer adverse events were reported by patients treated with DepoFoam bupivacaine (59.8%) versus placebo (67.7%). DepoFoam bupivacaine, a long-acting local analgesic, provided extended pain relief and decreased opioid use after bunionectomy, compared with placebo.

A fundamental understanding regarding postprandial glycemic responses to foods containing whole yellow-pea flour (WYPF) remains unknown. This, alongside concerns that WYPF possesses unfavorable sensory characteristics has limited the incorporation of WYPF into new functional food products as a healthy novel ingredient. The objective of this study was to evaluate how WYPF modulates postprandial glycemic responses as well as sensory characteristics in novel foods. In a single-blind crossover trial, the present study assessed postprandial glycemic responses of banana bread, biscotti, and spaghetti containing either WYPF or whole wheat flour (WWF). Boiled yellow peas (BYP) and white bread (WB) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. On day 1, subjects evaluated appearance, taste, texture, smell as well as overall acceptance of each WYPF and WWF food on a 5-point hedonic scale. WYPF banana bread (97.9 +/- 17.8 mmol x min/L) and biscotti (83 +/- 13 mmol x min/L), as well as BYP (112.3 +/- 19.9 mmol x min/L), reduced (P < 0.05) glycemic responses compared to WB (218.1 +/- 29.5 mmol x min/L). The glycemic response of WYPF pasta (160.7 +/- 19.4 mmol x min/L) was comparable to WB. WYPF biscotti produced a lower (P = 0.019) postprandial glycemic response compared to WWF biscotti (117.2 +/- 13.1 mmol x min/L). Hedonic responses between corresponding foods were similar except for the WYPF pasta (2.9 +/- 0.9) which possessed a lower sensory score (P = 0.02) for smell compared to WWF pasta (3.6 +/- 1). WYPF can be used to produce low-glycemic functional foods possessing sensory attributes that are comparable to identical food products containing WWF.

Many studies have demonstrated that low heart rate variability (HRV) is a risk for high mortality and morbidity in patients with cardiovascular diseases. The primary purpose of the study was to evaluate whether pregabalin improves HRV in patients with diabetes and painful peripheral neuropathy. Resting heart rates were collected by using the LifeShirt System, developed by VivoMetrics (Ventura, Calif), at baseline and at the end of a 4-week intervention of pregabalin or placebo in patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Heart rate variability analysis was performed on the collected R-R intervals using the Vivo- VMLA-036-00 3 Logic of the LifeShirt system. Of the 40 patients enrolled in the study, 70% completed the end of 4-week assessments (n = 15 in pregabalin and n = 14 in placebo). Compared with placebo, pregabalin treatment resulted in significant improvement in HRV measured by frequency domain analysis, that is, a reduction in low frequency-high frequency ratio (-1.30 \u00b1 2.89 vs 0.37 \u00b1 0.33, P = 0.03) and power of normalized low frequency (-0.049 \u00b1 0.092 vs 0.0066 \u00b1 0.023, P = 0.02), as well as an increase in power of normalized high frequency (0.039 \u00b1 0.094 vs -0.038 \u00b1 0.066, P = 0.02). Furthermore, pregabalin resulted in greater reduction of pain and symptoms of anxiety and greater improvement of quality of life. The improvement of HRV measures were not correlated with change of those measures. In conclusion, 4-week pregabalin treatment improved HRV in patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

Intubation was performed under local anaesthesia and remifentanil sedation with spontaneous ventilation. The primary endpoint was the proportion of intubations which met the following quality requirements: successful intubation (\u2264 2 attempts and duration <180 s) and good tolerability (Fahey scale <2). Secondary endpoints included the operational problems encountered and patients' perception of the procedure immediately and 7 days after the intervention. Using a one-stage Fleming design, 32 patients were required to complete the study. Forty-one eligible adult patients were enrolled. Between February 2008 and March 2009, the primary endpoint could be evaluated in 33 patients. Quality requirements were met in 26 patients (78.8%) and not met in seven patients (five were intubated with the Bonfils fibrescope and two using another technique).

Pain following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) interferes with rehabilitation. Capsaicin applied in high concentration to nociceptors can cause relatively selective C-fibre desensitization for a period of weeks to months. Resultant long-lasting analgesia might facilitate rehabilitation. The objective of this study was to determine if direct instillation of a high-concentration capsaicin preparation into the wound following TKA would provide pain relief, improve physical functioning and rehabilitation, and reduce opioid requirements. This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase II trial carried out in a teaching hospital system. Non-opioid-tolerant males or females aged 18-85 years with a body mass index (BMI) \u226445\u2009kg/m2, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1-3 and end-stage osteoarthritis who were scheduled for primary unilateral TKA were included. Patients received placebo vehicle or capsaicin 15\u2009mg (Anesiva 4975) by instillation immediately prior to wound closure. Surgery was conducted under spinal anaesthesia and femoral nerve block. Postoperative rescue analgesia consisted of intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with morphine for 24 hours; oral oxycodone was provided thereafter as needed. It was hypothesized prior to data collection that capsaicin instillation would reduce postoperative pain scores and result in improved patient satisfaction and ambulation. The primary outcome was the area under the numerical rating scale (NRS) for pain score-time curve from 4 to 24 hours (AUC(4-24)). NRS for pain scores were obtained every 4 hours for 24 hours then daily with ambulation and physical therapy for 3 days. Function and patient satisfaction were assessed at 14, 28 and 42 days. Data from 14 patients (seven per group) from a single centre (data were not available from other sites because of sponsor bankruptcy) were available for this preliminary report. AUC(4-24) was not significantly different clinically (placebo 70.3; capsaicin 65.7) in this sample; however, a significant opioid-sparing effect was seen in the capsaicin group despite the fact that patients in this group had higher BMIs. Pain scores tended to be lower in the capsaicin group, despite the fact that patients in this group received significantly less rescue opioid medication. Morphine use from 12-24 hours was lower (capsaicin group mean 13.4\u2009mg; 95% confidence interval [CI] 7.4, 19.5; range 10-21\u2009mg vs placebo group mean 25.9\u2009mg; 95% CI 19.8, 32.0; range 15-36\u2009mg; p\u2009=\u20090.009). Total intravenous and oral opioid in morphine equivalents over 72 hours was also lower with capsaicin compared with placebo (p\u2009=\u20090.03). Active range of motion (ROM) was also significantly improved at day 14 in the capsaicin group compared with the placebo group (p\u2009=\u20090.0014). A higher percentage of patients in the capsaicin group reported being extremely satisfied with their treatment. The only statistically significant difference in treatment-emergent adverse events was for pruritus, which was more frequent in the placebo group (p\u2009=\u20090.03). Despite having higher BMIs, patients in the capsaicin group achieved comparable or better pain scores with significantly less opioid use in the first 3 postoperative days. They also had less pruritus, which may have been a consequence of the opioid-sparing effect. The effects of capsaicin with respect to function, however, appeared to be longer lasting, with improved active ROM reported at 14 days.

At baseline we carried out neuropsychological assessment with mini-mental, Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), Blessed Dementia Rating Scale, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, cognitive part (ADAS-cog), neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI), and disability assessment for dementia (DAD), as well as (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in several areas of the brain. Patients were randomized to receive either donepezil or memantine for 6 months. After this elapse of time we repeated the same procedures and observed the changes in clinical scales (ADAS-cog, NPI, DAD), as well as the changes in metabolite levels in every area of exploration (temporal, pre-frontal, posterior cingulated (PCG), and occipital), especially those of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) which is regarded as a surrogate marker of neuronal density. A total of sixty-three patients completed the trial. We did not see significant differences in clinical scales and metabolite levels between those on donepezil (n = 32) and those on memantine (n = 31). In general, more patients worsened than improved on either of the drugs. The changes in the NAA/creatine ratio in the PCG correlated significantly with the changes in the ADAS-cog (P = 0.004). Donepezil and memantine have similar modest clinical and spectroscopic effect on mild to moderate AD. MRS could be useful to monitor progression of the disease.

Although consumption of various plant sterol (PS)-enriched beverages is effective in lowering plasma cholesterol, the lipid-lowering potential of PS in a soymilk format has not been investigated thoroughly. Therefore, to evaluate the efficacy of PS-enriched soy beverages on plasma lipids and cholesterol kinetics, we conducted two separate 28 d dietary controlled cross-over studies. In study 1, the cholesterol-lowering efficacy of a low-fat (2 g/serving) PS enriched soy beverage was examined in 33 normal cholesterolemic subjects in comparison with 1% dairy milk. In study 2, we investigated the efficacy of a moderate-fat (3.5 g/serving) PS-enriched soy beverage on plasma cholesterol concentrations and cholesterol kinetic responses in 23 hypercholesterolemic subjects compared with 1% dairy milk. Both the low and moderate-fat PS-enriched soymilk varieties provided 1.95 g PS/d. Endpoint plasma variables were analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA using baseline values as covariates for plasma lipid measurements. In comparison with the 1% dairy milk control, the low-fat soy beverage reduced (P < 0.05) total and LDL-cholesterol by 10 and 13%, respectively. Consumption of the moderate-fat PS-enriched soy beverage reduced (P < 0.05) plasma total and LDL-cholesterol by 12 and 15% respectively. Fasting triglycerides were reduced by 9.4% following consumption of the moderate-fat soy beverage in comparison with the 1% dairy milk. Both low and moderate-fat PS-enriched soy varieties reduced (P < 0.05) LDL:HDL and TC:HDL ratios compared with the 1% dairy milk control. Consumption of the moderate-fat PS-enriched soymilk reduced (P < 0.05) cholesterol absorption by 27%, but did not alter cholesterol synthesis in comparison with 1% dairy milk. We conclude that, compared to 1% dairy milk, consumption of low and moderate-fat PS-enriched soy beverages represents an effective dietary strategy to reduce circulating lipid concentrations in normal to hypercholesterolemic individuals by reducing intestinal cholesterol absorption.

Preclinical evaluations of AZD5672, a small-molecule antagonist of CCR5, were performed, including studies of ligand binding and chemotaxis. The pharmacokinetics of AZD5672 were assessed in both single- and multiple-dose studies in healthy volunteers. A randomized, placebo-controlled, phase IIb study was conducted in patients with active RA receiving methotrexate. Treatment arms were AZD5672 (20, 50, 100, or 150 mg orally, once daily), matched placebo, or open-label etanercept (50 mg subcutaneously, once weekly). The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving a 20% improvement response on the American College of Rheumatology improvement criteria (ACR20) at week 12. Secondary end points included the ACR20 over time, as well as 50% (ACR50) and 70% (ACR70) improvement responses, changes in individual components of the ACR improvement criteria, and disease activity measured with the Disease Activity Score based on the 28-joint count. AZD5672 was a highly potent and selective antagonist of CCR5, displaying nonproportional steady-state pharmacokinetics while inhibiting internalization of CCR5 in an ex vivo macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b2 stimulation assay in which AZD5672 was evaluated over the 20-150-mg dose range. In the phase IIb study testing this dose range in patients with RA (n = 371 patients randomized to received treatment), AZD5672 was generally well tolerated, with no unexpected adverse events. There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients achieving an ACR20 response at week 12 between those receiving any dose of AZD5672 and those receiving placebo; etanercept was significantly more efficacious than AZD5672 and placebo.

This study assessed the efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in psoriasis patients and assessed dosing intensification in partial responders. In this multicentre, phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 1230 patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis (defined by a psoriasis area and severity index [PASI] score > or =12, and at least 10% total body surface area involvement) were randomly assigned to receive ustekinumab 45 mg (n=409) or 90 mg (n=411) at weeks 0 and 4, then every 12 weeks, or placebo (n=410). Partial responders (ie, patients achieving > or =50% but <75% improvement from baseline in PASI) were re-randomised at week 28 to continue dosing every 12 weeks or escalate to dosing every 8 weeks. Both randomisations were done with a minimisation method via a centralised interactive voice response. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving at least 75% improvement in PASI (PASI 75) at week 12. Analyses were by intention to treat.

Conjunctival biopsy allows the determination of specific tissue concentration data for topical ophthalmic agents. Drug concentration analysis at various time points following instillation allows interpretation of the residence time and a rationale for dosing frequency. This study compared the pharmacokinetic parameters of 2 currently available topical ocular antibiotics-azithromycin ophthalmic solution 1% and moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5%-in the conjunctiva of healthy volunteers after a single topical administration. This single-dose, randomized, open-label, active-controlled clinical trial was conducted at ORA Clinical Research and Development, North Andover, Massachusetts. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of azithromycin or moxifloxacin and to undergo biopsy sampling at 30 minutes or 2, 12, or 24 hours after administration.

This randomised, open-label, phase 3, parallel-group trial was undertaken between 1996 and 2004. 855 patients were randomly assigned at 35 centres in the Nordic countries by block randomisation to three groups: observation only (group A); 4 weeks of induction (interferon alfa-2b 10 million units flat dose subcutaneously 5 days per week) followed by 12 months of maintenance therapy (interferon alfa-2b 10 million units flat dose subcutaneously 3 days per week; group B); or 1 month of induction and 24 months of maintenance (group C). Neither investigators nor patients were masked to treatment assignment. Patients were stratified for country and tumour stage; patients with stage III disease were further stratified for presence of metastatic lymph nodes at primary diagnosis versus at relapse, palpable versus non-palpable lymph-node metastases, and number of metastatic lymph nodes. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the two interferon alfa-2b groups combined. Analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01259934. 284 patients were assigned to group A, 285 to group B, and 286 to group C; all patients were analysed. The median follow-up time was 72\u00b74 months (IQR 46\u00b79-98\u00b70). We recorded no significant improvement in overall survival in patients given interferon alfa-2b compared with observation: median overall survival was 56\u00b71 months (IQR 22\u00b73 to >120\u00b70) in group A, 72\u00b71 months (25\u00b78 to >120) in group B, and 64\u00b73 months (24\u00b77 to >120) in group C (p=0\u00b7600). Hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival were 0\u00b791 (95% CI 0\u00b774-1\u00b710; p=0\u00b7642) for groups B and C combined versus observation; 0\u00b791 (0\u00b772-1\u00b714; p=0\u00b7652) for group B versus observation; and 0\u00b791 (0\u00b772-1\u00b715; p=0\u00b7858) for group C versus observation. Median RFS was 23\u00b72 months (IQR 5\u00b76 to <120) in group A, 37\u00b78 months (10\u00b78 to >120) in group B, and 28\u00b76 months (8\u00b76 to >120) in group C (p=0\u00b7034).

The most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were fatigue (five in group A [1\u00b78%], 28 in group B [9\u00b78%], and 32 in group C [11\u00b72%]), myalgia (three [1\u00b71%], 15 [5\u00b73%], 14 [4\u00b79%], respectively), and thrombocytopenia (15 [5\u00b73%], 23 [8\u00b71%], eight [2\u00b78%], respectively). Adjuvant therapy with intermediate-dose interferon alfa-2b did not significantly improve overall survival. Interferon alfa-2b with 1-year maintenance therapy significantly improved RFS, but we recorded no significant effect for 2-year maintenance therapy.

After 12 months, treatment was unblinded. Patients treated with rosuvastatin and aspirin were continued on the same medications for another 12 months. Plasma levels of homocysteine, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, P-selectin, and thrombomodulin were measured at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months.

At 24 months, the IMT of the internal carotid arteries appeared to be decreased in patients treated with rosuvastatin, which was well tolerated.

This open-label, parallel-group, dose-ranging, multicenter trial randomized children, aged 6-12 years, with ADHD and persistent, serious conduct problems to receive oral molindone thrice daily for 9-12 weeks in four treatment groups: Group 1-10 mg (5 mg if weight <30 kg), group 2-20 mg (10 mg if <30 kg), group 3-30 mg (15 mg if <30 kg), and group 4-40 mg (20 mg if <30 kg). The primary outcome measure was to evaluate safety and tolerability of molindone in children with ADHD and serious conduct problems. Secondary outcome measures included change in Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form-Typical Intelligence Quotient (NCBRF-TIQ) Conduct Problem subscale scores, change in Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) and -Improvement (CGI-I) subscale scores from baseline to end point, and Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham rating scale-revised (SNAP-IV) ADHD-related subscale scores. The study randomized 78 children; 55 completed the study. Treatment with molindone was generally well tolerated, with no clinically meaningful changes in laboratory or physical examination findings. The most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) included somnolence (n=9), weight increase (n=8), akathisia (n=4), sedation (n=4), and abdominal pain (n=4). Mean weight increased by 0.54 kg, and mean body mass index by 0.24 kg/m(2). The incidence of AEs and treatment-related AEs increased with increasing dose. NCBRF-TIQ subscale scores improved in all four treatment groups, with 34%, 34%, 32%, and 55% decreases from baseline in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. CGI-S and SNAP-IV scores improved over time in all treatment groups, and CGI-I scores improved to the greatest degree in group 4.

In this trial, we sought to determine whether a BIS-based protocol is better than a protocol based on a measurement of end-tidal anesthetic gas (ETAG) for decreasing anesthesia awareness in patients at high risk for this complication. We randomly assigned 2000 patients to BIS-guided anesthesia (target BIS range, 40 to 60) or ETAG-guided anesthesia (target ETAG range, 0.7 to 1.3 minimum alveolar concentration [MAC]). Postoperatively, patients were assessed for anesthesia awareness at three intervals (0 to 24 hours, 24 to 72 hours, and 30 days after extubation). We assessed 967 and 974 patients from the BIS and ETAG groups, respectively. Two cases of definite anesthesia awareness occurred in each group (absolute difference, 0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.56 to 0.57%). The BIS value was greater than 60 in one case of definite anesthesia awareness, and the ETAG concentrations were less than 0.7 MAC in three cases.

After 6 months of treatment, patients randomized to training and placebo had an increase in PWT of 218 \u00b1 367 seconds, while those randomized to training plus PLC had an increase of 266 \u00b1 243 seconds, P = .258. Across the total study cohort, the dose of exercise training (total number of minutes of exercise of at least moderate intensity) was correlated with the change in PWT (r = 0.259, P = .048), suggesting that the monitored exercise was effective in improving walking performance in both treatment arms. In all subjects, the increase in PWT from baseline to month 6 was correlated with the amount of exercise training. However, although favoring PLC, the combination of exercise training and PLC did not result in a statistically significant benefit in peak treadmill performance or quality of life compared with exercise alone.

Wound healing is impaired in diabetes mellitus, but the mechanisms involved in this process are virtually unknown. Proteins belonging to the insulin signaling pathway respond to insulin in the skin of rats. The purpose of this study was to investigate the regulation of the insulin signaling pathway in wound healing and skin repair of normal and diabetic rats, and, in parallel, the effect of a topical insulin cream on wound healing and on the activation of this pathway. We investigated insulin signaling by immunoblotting during wound healing of control and diabetic animals with or without topical insulin. Diabetic patients with ulcers were randomized to receive topical insulin or placebo in a prospective, double-blind and placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (NCT 01295177) of wound healing. Expression of IR, IRS-1, IRS-2, SHC, ERK, and AKT are increased in the tissue of healing wounds compared to intact skin, suggesting that the insulin signaling pathway may have an important role in this process. These pathways were attenuated in the wounded skin of diabetic rats, in parallel with an increase in the time of complete wound healing. Upon topical application of insulin cream, the wound healing time of diabetic animals was normalized, followed by a reversal of defective insulin signal transduction. In addition, the treatment also increased expression of other proteins, such as eNOS (also in bone marrow), VEGF, and SDF-1\u03b1 in wounded skin. In diabetic patients, topical insulin cream markedly improved wound healing, representing an attractive and cost-free method for treating this devastating complication of diabetes.

We randomly assigned 820 patients with advanced colorectal cancer to receive either first-line treatment with capecitabine, second-line irinotecan, and third-line capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (sequential treatment; n=410) or first-line treatment capecitabine plus irinotecan and second-line capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (combination treatment; n=410). The primary endpoint was overall survival. Analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov with the number NCT00312000. 17 patients (nine in the sequential treatment group, eight in the combination group) were found to be ineligible and were excluded from the analysis. 675 (84%) patients died during the study: 336 in the sequential group and 339 in the combination group. Median overall survival was 16.3 (95% CI 14.3-18.1) months for sequential treatment and 17.4 (15.2-19.2) months for combination treatment (p=0.3281). The hazard ratio for combination versus sequential treatment was 0.92 (95% CI 0.79-1.08; p=0.3281). The frequency of grade 3-4 toxicity over all lines of treatment did not differ significantly between the two groups, except for grade 3 hand-foot syndrome, which occurred more often with sequential treatment than with combination treatment (13%vs 7%; p=0.004). Combination treatment does not significantly improve overall survival compared with the sequential use of cytotoxic drugs in advanced colorectal cancer.

One hundred seventy-one patients received intravenous pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) day 1 and oral ABT-751 or placebo days 1 to 14 of 21-day cycles. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end point included overall survival (OS); pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were also analyzed. The recommended phase II dose of ABT-751 with pemetrexed is 200 mg. Fatigue, constipation, anemia, nausea, and diarrhea were the most common toxicities in both study arms. No pharmacokinetic interactions were observed. Median PFS in the ABT-751 arm was 2.3 months versus 1.9 for placebo (P = .819, log-rank) for the intention-to-treat population. However, differences in PFS (P = .112, log-rank) and OS (P = .034, log-rank; median 3.3 v 8.1 months) favoring ABT-751 were seen in the squamous NSCLC subgroup. Baseline circulating tumor cell concentrations were predictive of improved OS (P = .013).

Oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) are usually divided into postprandial and basal drugs. As their actions are probably more complex, it is important to ascertain which factors can modulate their effects. Thirty-one type 2 diabetes patients treated with metformin (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] 6.5-9%; median, 7.3%) and enrolled in two randomized controlled studies were allocated to either rosiglitazone (Group 1, n = 8) or glimepiride (Group 2, n = 7) and to either vildagliptin or sitagliptin (Group 3 considered as a whole, n = 16). All patients were investigated using continuous glucose monitoring at baseline and after 8-12 weeks of add-on therapy. Areas under the 24-h glycemic profile curves (AUCs) were determined for assessing postprandial (AUCpp), basal (AUCb), and total (AUCtotal) hyperglycemia. After calculation of decrements in AUCs (\u2202AUCs) from baseline to end of treatment periods, the following contribution ratios of postprandial and basal decrements to the overall glucose decrement were determined: \u2202AUCpp/\u2202AUCtotal and \u2202AUCb/\u2202AUCtotal (%). \u2202AUCpp/\u2202AUCtotal and \u2202AUCb/\u2202AUCtotal were negatively and positively, respectively, associated (R(2) = 0.195, P = 0.013) with baseline HbA1c. \u2202AUCpp/\u2202AUCtotal was significantly higher (50.8 \u00b1 4.8%) in patients with HbA1c <7.3% than in those with HbA1c \u2265 7.3% (27.0 \u00b1 4.4%) (P = 0.001). After adjustment on baseline HbA1c, \u2202AUCpp/\u2202AUCtotal was greater in Group 3 (44.0 \u00b1 1.6%) than in Group 1 (32.1 \u00b1 4%) and 2 (37.0 \u00b1 3.1%) (P = 0.007). Gliptins, glitazones and sulfonylureas concomitantly act on basal and postprandial glucose even though gliptins are more efficient on postprandial glucose.

There is limited published data at higher doses and none in the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). This open-label, pilot study was designed to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of escitalopram in doses up to 50 mg in MDD. It was conducted in 60 primary care patients with MDD who had not responded to adequate treatment with citalopram. Patients were treated with escalating doses of escitalopram up to 50 mg for up to 32 weeks until they achieved remission (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] \u2264 8) or failed to tolerate the dose. Forty-two patients (70%) completed the study. Twenty-one patients (35%) achieved remission with 8 of the 21 patients (38%) needing the 50 mg dose to achieve remission. Median time to remission was 24 weeks and median dose in remission was 30 mg. No significant safety issues were identified although tolerability appeared to decline above a dose of 40 mg with 26% of patients unable to tolerate 50 mg. Twelve (20%) patients had adverse events leading to discontinuation. The most common adverse events were headache (35%), nausea, diarrhoea and nasopharyngitis (all 25%).

Is this the solution to the headaches?  Application of nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate) ointment with perianal administration is a widely used treatment for chronic anal fissure. However, headache occurs after application in 20% to 70% patients and leads to withdrawal in 10% of patients. The aim of the study was to investigate whether endoanal application of the ointment may lower the frequency of headaches without sacrificing effectiveness. compare the effects of perianal versus endoanal administration of nitroglycerin ointment on frequency of headache and rate of healing in the treatment of chronic anal fissure. This was a prospective randomized clinical trial (ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT01132391). Study participants were consecutive patients with a diagnosis of chronic anal fissure treated at a university teaching hospital in Elche, Alicante, Spain. Patients were randomly assigned to receive perianal (n = 26) or endoanal (n = 26) administration of 0.4% nitroglycerin ointment (375 mg of ointment containing 1.5 mg of glyceryl trinitrate), applied every 12 hours over an 8-week period. The primary endpoint of the study was the number of patients with headache within 3 hours after application of the ointment, analyzed with the intention-to-treat principle. Intensity of headache pain was rated on a 10-point visual analog scale. Secondary endpoints included frequencies of fissure healing, anorectal pain, rectal bleeding, pruritus, and incontinence. Headaches were reported in 14 (54%) patients with perianal treatment and in 6 patients (23%) with anorectal treatment (p = 0.003). The median headache pain score was 6 (range, 0-10) in the perianal group and 4.5 (range, 0-10) in the endoanal group (p = 0.03). Disabling headaches led to crossover from perianal to endoanal treatment in 4 patients (15%), and from endoanal to perianal treatment in 1 patient (4%) (p = 0.004). Of the 4 patients who switched from perianal to endoanal treatment, 2 reported improvement in headaches and 2 stopped treatment. The patient who switched from endoanal to perianal treatment also showed no improvement and stopped treatment. The healing rate at 24-week follow-up was 62% (16 patients) with perianal treatment and 77% (20 patients) with endoanal treatment (p < 0.05). Effects on sphincter pressure were not evaluated because manometric measurements were not available. Endoanal application significantly reduces the frequency of headaches due to treatment with 0.4% nitroglycerin ointment and results in a higher healing rate compared with perianal administration. However, roughly 1 in 4 patients still experiences headaches. Our data suggest that endoanal application may be a better option for treatment of anal fissure with nitroglycerin ointment.

This study compared the efficacy of sugammadex and neostigmine for reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium for facilitating elective surgery. This randomised, multicentre, parallel-group trial included 98 adult patients. Patients received intravenous propofol for induction followed by sevoflurane maintenance anaesthesia. Neuromuscular blockade was monitored using acceleromyography and a train-of-four (TOF) mode of stimulation. Patients were randomly allocated to receive sugammadex 2.0 mg kg(-1) or neostigmine 50 microg kg (-1) (with glycopyrrolate 10 microg kg(-1)) at reappearance of the second response of the TOF (mean 16% twitch height of first response) after the last dose of rocuronium. Safety was evaluated by assessing adverse events, laboratory variables and vital signs. Time to recovery of the TOF ratio of 0.9 after sugammadex compared with neostigmine was significantly shorter (P < 0.0001), being 1.5 versus 18.6 min (geometric means).

Due to the many problems associated with reduced balance and mobility, providing an effective and engaging rehabilitation regimen is essential to progress recovery from impairments and to help prevent further degradation of motor skills. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and benefits of physical therapy based on a task-oriented approach delivered via an engaging, interactive video game paradigm. The intervention focused on performing targeted dynamic tasks, which included reactive balance controls and environmental interaction. This study was a randomized controlled trial. The study was conducted in a geriatric day hospital. Thirty community-dwelling and ambulatory older adults attending the day hospital for treatment of balance and mobility limitations participated in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control group or an experimental group. The control group received the typical rehabilitation program consisting of strengthening and balance exercises provided at the day hospital. The experimental group received a program of dynamic balance exercises coupled with video game play, using a center-of-pressure position signal as the computer mouse. The tasks were performed while standing on a fixed floor surface, with progression to a compliant sponge pad. Each group received 16 sessions, scheduled 2 per week, with each session lasting 45 minutes. Data for the following measures were obtained before and after treatment: Berg Balance Scale, Timed \"Up & Go\" Test, Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction and Balance, and spatiotemporal gait variables assessed in an instrumented carpet system test. Findings demonstrated significant improvements in posttreatment balance performance scores for both groups, and change scores were significantly greater in the experimental group compared with the control group. No significant treatment effect was observed in either group for the Timed \"Up & Go\" Test or spatiotemporal gait variables. The sample size was small, and there were group differences at baseline in some performance measures. Dynamic balance exercises on fixed and compliant sponge surfaces were feasibly coupled to interactive game-based exercise.

One of the central unanswered questions in prostate cancer research is the significance of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-induced improvements in (99m)Tc-methylene diphosphonate ((99m)Tc-MDP) bone scans. Multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibition has recently shown promise in the management of castration-resistant prostate cancer. In some cases, TKI inhibition has produced unprecedented improvements in bone metastases as detected by (99m)Tc-MDP bone scans. The significance of these improvements is not known. In order to gain insight about the effects of TKIs on bone scans in prostate cancer, we systematically evaluated images from a phase II study of sunitinib, a multitargeted TKI. We analyzed images and data from a previously reported open-label phase II study that enrolled 34 men with advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer. Participants received sunitinib in 6-wk cycles (50 mg daily; 4 wk on, 2 wk off). We examined baseline and 12-wk bone scan images. Partial response was defined as an improvement of at least 50% in previous metastatic lesions subjectively or a change from prior diffuse skeletal metastases (superscan) to recognizable individual metastatic lesions. Our primary objective was to define the incidence of at least partial bone scan response. We also examined concomitant changes in CT and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) evidence of disease. Analysis at 12 wk revealed 1 partial response by the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) and 2 confirmed PSA responses. There were 25 subjects who underwent bone scans at both time points (baseline and week 12) and who had bone metastases detectable at baseline. Within that group of 25, we found 5 bone scan partial responses and 1 complete response. None of those 6 subjects exhibited a PSA response (\u226550% decline from baseline) or RECIST response. We found a relatively high rate of (99m)Tc-MDP bone scan response to sunitinib among men with metastatic prostate cancer. Further, we found that none of the subjects exhibiting bone scan responses experienced concordant improvements in PSA or CT evidence of disease by accepted criteria. This discordance argues that osteoblastic assessment provides an incomplete assessment of treatment-induced changes. Rational development of multitargeted TKIs for prostate cancer requires improved understanding of treatment-induced bone scan changes. Optimal imaging strategies may include evaluation of perfusion or direct tumor activity.

Triptorelin 6-month formulation was developed to offer greater convenience to both patients and physicians by reducing the injection frequency. The efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety of a new 6-month formulation of triptorelin were investigated over 12 months (48 weeks). The primary objective was to evaluate the formulation in achieving castrate serum testosterone levels (< or = 1.735 nmol/L or < or = 50 ng/dL) on day 29 and in maintaining castration at months 2-12. Absence of luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulation and change in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level were also assessed. An open-label, non-comparative, phase III study in 120 patients with advanced prostate cancer was conducted from July 2006 to August 2007 in private and public institutions in South Africa. Each patient received two consecutive intramuscular injections of triptorelin embonate (pamoate) 22.5 mg at an interval of 24 weeks. In all patients, testosterone (primary outcome measurement) was measured at baseline and then every 4 weeks; LH was measured before and 2 hours after the two injections. PSA was measured on day 1 and at weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48. Adverse events were recorded at each visit. In the intent-to-treat population, 97.5% (95% CI 92.9, 99.5) of patients achieved castrate serum testosterone levels by day 29, and 93.0% (95% CI 86.8, 97.0) maintained castration at months 2-12. After the second injection, 98.3% of patients showed absence of LH stimulation. The most frequent drug-related adverse events were hot flushes (71.7% of patients). No patient withdrew from the study as a result of an adverse event. The triptorelin 6-month formulation was well tolerated and was able to achieve and maintain castration for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. By reducing the frequency of required injections, this new formulation offers a more convenient treatment regimen. (Clinical Trial Registration,NCT00751790 at www.clinicaltrials.gov).

Phenylketonuria (PKU) results from impaired breakdown of phenylalanine (Phe) due to deficient phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) activity. Sapropterin dihydrochloride (sapropterin, Kuvan\u00ae) is the only US- and EU-approved pharmaceutical version of naturally occurring 6R-BH(4), the cofactor required for PAH activity. Sapropterin enhances residual PAH activity in sapropterin-responsive PKU patients and, in conjunction with dietary management, helps reduce blood Phe concentrations for optimal control. Approval was based on the positive safety and efficacy results of four international clinical studies, the longest of which was 22 weeks in duration. To evaluate the safety of long-term treatment with sapropterin in PKU subjects who participated in previous Phase 3 sapropterin trials. PKU-008 was designed as a Phase 3b, multicenter, multinational, open-label, 3-year extension trial to evaluate the long-term safety of sapropterin in patients with PKU who were classified as sapropterin responders and participated in prior Phase 3 sapropterin studies: 111 subjects aged 4-50 years completed prior studies and were subsequently enrolled in study PKU-008. Routine safety monitoring was performed at 3-month intervals and included adverse event reporting, blood Phe monitoring, clinical laboratory evaluations, physical examinations and vital sign measurements. Average exposure during PKU-008 was 658.7\u00b1221.3 days (range, 56-953; median, 595). The average total duration of participation in multiple studies (PKU-001, PKU-003, PKU-004, and PKU-008; or PKU-006 and PKU-008) was 799.0\u00b1237.5 days (range, 135-1151). The mean sapropterin dose was 16.2\u00b14.7 mg/kg/day. Most adverse events were considered unrelated to treatment, were mild or moderate in severity, and were consistent with prior studies of sapropterin. No age-specific differences were observed in adverse event reporting. Three subjects discontinued treatment due to adverse events that were considered possibly or probably related to study treatment (one each of difficulty concentrating, decreased platelet count, and intermittent diarrhea). No deaths were reported. Of seven reported serious adverse events, one was considered possibly related to study treatment (gastroesophageal reflux). There were no laboratory or physical examination abnormalities requiring medical interventions. For most subjects, blood Phe concentrations were consistently within target range, confirming the durability of response in subjects undergoing extended treatment with sapropterin. Sapropterin treatment was found to be safe and well tolerated at doses of 5 to 20mg/kg/day for an average exposure of 659 days. This study supports the safety and tolerability of sapropterin as long-term treatment for patients with PKU.

Activation of the renal renin-angiotensin system in patients with diabetes mellitus appears to contribute to the risk of nephropathy. Recently, it has been recognized than an elevation of prorenin in plasma also provides a strong indication of risk of nephropathy. This study was designed to examine renin-angiotensin system control mechanisms in the patient with diabetes mellitus. We enrolled 43 individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. All individuals were on a high-salt diet to minimize the contribution of the systemic renin-angiotensin system. After an acute exposure to captopril (25\u200amg), they were randomized to treatment with either irbesartan (300\u200amg) or aliskiren (300\u200amg) for 2 weeks. All agents acutely lowered blood pressure and plasma aldosterone, and increased renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate. Yet, only captopril and aliskiren acutely increased plasma renin and decreased plasma angiotensin II, whereas irbesartan acutely affected neither renin nor angiotensin II. Plasma renin and angiotensin II subsequently did increase upon chronic irbesartan treatment. When given on day 14, irbesartan and aliskiren again induced the above hemodynamic, renal and adrenal effects, yet without significantly changing plasma renin. Irbesartan at that time did not affect plasma angiotensin II, whereas aliskiren lowered it to almost zero. The relative resistance of the renal renin response to acute (irbesartan) and chronic (irbesartan and aliskiren) renin-angiotensin system blockade supports the concept of an activated renal renin-angiotensin system in diabetes, particularly at the level of the juxtaglomerular cell, and implies that diabetic patients might require higher doses of renin-angiotensin system blockers to fully suppress the renal renin-angiotensin system.

In post hoc analyses, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers measured at baseline and after vaccination were analyzed for young adults (age, 18-64 years), \"younger elderly\" adults (age, 65-74 years), and \"very elderly\" adults (age, >or=75 years). At baseline, 28.8% of young adults, 43.9% of younger elderly adults, and 62.9% of very elderly adults had HI titers to A/2009 H1N1 of >or=1:40. A single 7.5\u2010\u03bcg dose induced HI titers >or=1:40 in 94.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 91.8%-96.3%) of all adults. After one 7.5\u2010\u03bcg dose, the geometric mean titers achieved were 326.4 (95% CI, 275.9-386.0) in young adults, 155.4 (95% CI, 123.4-195.8) in \"younger elderly\" adults, and 243.9 (95% CI, 167.1-356.0) in \"very elderly\" adults. This large phase-2 trial demonstrated that a single 7.5\u2010\u03bcg dose of a monovalent unadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine induced protective HI antibody levels in adults of all ages, including very elderly adults.

The aim of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, safety profile, and descriptive efficacy of tigecycline. In this Phase II, multicenter, open-label clinical trial, children aged 8 to 11 years with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI), or complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) were administered tigecycline 0.75, 1, or 1.25 mg/kg. A total of 58 patients received \u2265 1 dose of tigecycline (31 boys; 44 white; mean age, 10 years; mean weight, 35 kg); 47 had data from samples available for PK analysis.

The aim of this multicentre trial was to assess whether an immediate invasive approach is superior to an early invasive or a selective invasive approach with respect to reduction of large infarction. Patients with NSTEMI were randomized to either an immediate (<2 h after randomization; n= 201), an early (10-48 h after randomization; n= 200), or a selective invasive approach with high invasive percentage (n= 201). The primary outcome was the peak creatine kinase (CK)-myocardial band (MB) activity during index hospitalization; key secondary clinical endpoints were the composite of (i) death and non-fatal infarction; (ii) death, non-fatal infarction, and refractory ischaemia; (iii) death, non-fatal infarction, refractory ischaemia, and rehospitalization for unstable angina within 6 months. The median time from randomization to angiography was 1.1 h in the immediate vs. 18.6 h in the early and 67.2 h in the selective invasive group (P< 0.001). There was no significant difference in the peak CK-MB activity between groups. The key secondary clinical endpoints were similar between groups at 6-month follow-up: death and infarction: 21.0 vs. 16.0 vs. 14.5%; P= 0.17; death, infarction, refractory ischaemia: 20.9 vs. 21.5 vs. 22.0%; P= 0.98; death, infarction, refractory ischaemia, rehospitalization: 26.0 vs. 26.5 vs. 24.5%; P= 0.91, respectively.

To explore the possibility that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) influences fibromyalgia symptoms via descending inhibition of nociception, we evaluated the effects of CBT on the nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) threshold, an objective measure of spinal nociceptive transmission. Female fibromyalgia patients (n = 32) were randomized to 6 weekly sessions of telephone-delivered CBT or usual care (UC). Assessments of the NFR threshold and clinical outcomes were conducted at baseline, week 6 (post-CBT), and week 12. From baseline to week 6, the NFR threshold increased in the CBT group and decreased in the UC group (mean +/- SD 4.4 +/- 13.7 mA versus -10.2 +/- 9.9 mA; P = 0.005). This difference was also apparent at week 12 (mean +/- SD 7.3 +/- 9.2 mA for CBT versus -5.4 +/- 13.5 mA for UC; P = 0.01). The groups reported similar reductions in NFR pain ratings at week 6 (mean +/- SD -20.2 +/- 23.9 for CBT versus -14.9 +/- 16.4 for UC; P = 0.8) and week 12 (mean +/- SD -8.9 +/- 25.3 for CBT versus -10.8 +/- 24.1 for UC; P = 0.4). Compared with UC, CBT reduced nociceptive responding in fibromyalgia patients. Moreover, while the UC group exhibited longitudinal decreases in both the stimulation level and pain associated with the NFR threshold, those receiving CBT required more intense stimulation to elicit the NFR as well as rated that stimulation as less painful than at baseline. These data indicate the need for a larger study to confirm that changes in nociceptive responsivity may underlie the benefits of CBT in fibromyalgia patients.

We hypothesized that anti-IL-13 treatment would inhibit allergen-induced late-phase asthmatic responses, airway hyperresponsiveness, and inflammation in subjects with asthma. Fifty-six subjects with mild, atopic asthma were recruited for two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group trials to compare IMA-638 and IMA-026 IL-13 antibody treatments with placebo treatment. Drug was administered on Days 1 and 8, and allergen challenges were performed on Days 14 and 35. The primary outcome variable was the late-phase area under the curve (AUC), and secondary outcome variables were the early- and late-phase maximum percent fall in FEV(1), early AUC, allergen-induced shift in airway hyperresponsiveness, and sputum eosinophils. The treatment difference with IMA-638 on Day 14 was -19.1 FEV(1) \u00d7 hour (95% confidence interval: -36.2, -1.9) for the allergen-induced early AUC and -23.8 FEV(1) \u00d7 hour (95% confidence interval: -46.4, -1.2) for the late AUC (both P < 0.05), but this effect was lost by Day 35.

Data were used from adult patients for whom both appetite and weight data were available from 4 prospective, 12- to 24-week clinical trials. Patients' appetites were assessed with Eating Behavior Assessment (EBA, Study 1), Platypus Appetite Rating Scale (PARS, Study 2), Eating Inventory (EI, Study 3), Food Craving Inventory (FCI, Study 3), and Eating Attitude Scale (EAS, Study 4). In Studies 1 (EBA) and 4 (EAS), patients who reported overall score increases on appetite scales, indicating an increase in appetite, experienced the greatest overall weight gains. However, in Studies 2 (PARS) and 3 (EI, FCI), patients who reported overall score increases on appetite scales did not experience greater weight changes than patients not reporting score increases. Early weight changes (2-4 weeks) were more positively correlated with overall weight changes than early or overall score changes on any utilized appetite assessment scale. No additional information was gained by adding early appetite change to early weight change in correlation to overall weight change. Early weight changes may be a more useful predictor for long-term weight changes than early score changes on appetite assessment scales.

In addition, it also evaluated compliance to the Centre for Biologics Evaluation and Research and Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) immunogenicity guidance criteria for pandemic influenza vaccines in adults. This phase III, observer-blind, randomized study (NCT00812981) enrolled 320 subjects aged 18-60 years into two groups to receive, 21 days apart, two doses of the formulation manufactured using either the thiomersal-containing process (Group TC) or the thiomersal-free process (Group TF). Blood samples collected before vaccination, 21 days after the second vaccine dose, and 6 months following the first vaccine dose (Days 0, 42, and 180) were analysed using a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. Safety assessments were made for the entire study period. Twenty-one days after the second dose of vaccine, both groups met the CHMP criteria for vaccine-homologous HI response (seroprotection rates/seroconversion rates \u2265 98.7%, seroconversion factor \u2265 121.9) and also for a heterologous HI response against the A/Vietnam/1194/2004 strain (seroprotection rates/seroconversion rates \u2265 81.3%, seroconversion factor \u2265 10.8). Six months after the first dose of vaccine, a marked persistence of the vaccine-homologous HI response was observed that still met one or more CHMP criteria. Pain at the injection site (Group TF 95%, Group TC 91.8%) and myalgia (Group TF 68.8%, Group TC 63.5%) were the most frequently recorded solicited symptoms.

Gout affects 3 million people in the United States, with rates almost 5 times higher in those aged 70 to 79 years compared with those aged < 50 years. Management of gout in elderly subjects can be complicated by comorbidities and polypharmacy. The purpose of this article was to review the unique clinical presentation, treatment, and prevention of gout in the older adult, with attention to the age-related factors that may affect outcomes in this population. PubMed and the Iowa Drug Information Service were searched (1944-January 14, 2011) for clinical studies of gout using the following search terms: gout, elderly, colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroid, prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, triamcinolone, allopurinol, febuxostat, probenecid, sulfinpyrazone, uricosuric, fenofibrate, and losartan. Articles were limited to clinical trials in humans, published in English. Citations of these articles were analyzed for additional relevant studies, and current guidelines were also consulted. Twenty-nine citations were reviewed. Evidence suggests that colchicine, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids are all efficacious in the treatment of acute gout in the older adult. Relevant limitations to colchicine use in the older adult include high cost, dosing restrictions in severe renal and hepatic dysfunction, gastrointestinal intolerance, and potential drug interactions. NSAID therapy is not recommended in older patients with congestive heart failure, renal failure, or gastrointestinal problems. Corticosteroids pose little risk when used in the short-term and may be preferred in patients with contraindications to colchicine or NSAIDs. Urate lowering with allopurinol for prevention of gout is well tolerated and has minimal cost per month; however, dose reduction is recommended in patients with renal impairment, which often results in failure to achieve target serum urate concentrations. Febuxostat does not require dose adjustment in mild to moderate renal disease and may be preferred in older people with this condition. Management of gout in the older adult involves careful selection of treatment based on potential benefits and consequences of therapy, considered in tandem with individual patient-specific characteristics.

Acarbose has been reported to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with impaired glucose tolerance and T2DM. We hypothesize that treatment with acarbose could attenuate glycemic excursions and reduce oxidative stress in patients with T2DM. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of acarbose versus glibenclamide on mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) and oxidative stress in patients with T2DM who are insufficiently controlled by metformin. T2DM outpatients aged 30 to 70 years who were taking single or dual oral antidiabetic drugs for \u22653 months and had a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) value between 7.0% and 11.0% were eligible. Patients were treated with metformin monotherapy (1500 mg daily) for 8 weeks, followed by randomization to either acarbose or glibenclamide add-on for 16 weeks. The dosage of acarbose and glibenclamide was 50 mg TID and 2.5 mg TID, respectively, for the first 4 weeks. In the following 12 weeks, the dosage was doubled in both groups. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for 72 hours and a meal tolerance test (MTT) after a 10-hour overnight fast were conducted before randomization and at the end of study. MAGE was calculated from CGM data. \u03b2-cell response to postprandial glucose increments was assessed by the ratio between incremental AUC of insulin and glucose during MTT. Oxidative stress was estimated by plasma oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) and urinary excretion rates of 8-iso prostaglandin F(2\u03b1) (8-iso PGF(2\u03b1)). The primary outcomes included changes in MAGE, plasma ox-LDL, and urinary excretion of 8-iso PGF(2\u03b1). Adverse events, including hypoglycemia, were recorded.

Patients (n = 552) with hepatitis C infections not responding to the combination of Peginterferon alfa-2a or 2b with ribavirin (RBV)were randomized to receive peginterferon alfa-2a 180 mg/week with RBV 800-1200 mg/daily plus either thymosin alpha-1 1.6 mg SC twice weekly (n = 275) or placebo (n = 277) for 48 weeks. Eighty-eight per cent of patients had HCV genotype 1, 6.6% type 4, 2.2% type 2 and 3.6% type 3. SVR rates in the intention to treat population were similar between thymosin alpha-1 and placebo (12.7%vs 10.5%; P = 0.407). Among patients who completed all 48 weeks of therapy, the SVR rate was significantly higher in the thymosin alpha-1 group at 41.0% (34/83) compared with 26.3% (26/99) in the placebo group (P = 0.048). No significant difference was observed between treatment groups in the incidence of adverse events. The addition of thymosin alpha-1 to the standard of care did not increase the on-treatment HCV viral response. Thymosin alpha-1 seems to play no role in the primary therapy of the disease. This study raises the hypothesis that thymosin alpha-1 may have a secondary therapeutic role as an adjuvant in the prevention of relapses in patients achieving a virologic response during therapy.

Currently, levodopa administered with decarboxylase inhibitors is the gold standard for the management of the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. In Argentina, only 1 commercial product is available with such composition; this study was contracted by the manufacturer to comply with new generic product regulations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the fasting bioavailability of a new generic formulation of levodopa 200 mg/benserazide 50 mg tablets (test) and compare this generic formulation with the branded formulation (reference) to meet regulatory criteria for marketing the test product in Argentina. A randomized-sequence, open-label, 2-period, crossover study was conducted between August and October 2009 in healthy Caucasian volunteers (n = 24; 18 males, aged 21 to 42 years, with a body mass index ranging from 19.7 to 26.0 kg/m(2)) in the fasted state. A single oral dose of the test or reference formulation was administered, and after a 7-day washout period, the other formulation was given. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 105 minutes and 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, and 6 hours after dosing. Levodopa plasma concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, without stereo-specificity assessment. The formulations were considered bioequivalent if the 90% CI of the geometric mean ratios (test/reference) for the C(max) and AUC(0-t) of levodopa were within the 0.8 to 1.25 range. Adverse events were monitored throughout the study, based on clinical parameters and patient reports. The geometric means (90% CI) of the C(max) for the test and reference formulations were 2462.02 (2312.06-3492.40) and 2542.85 (2394.49-3231.29) ng/mL, respectively; the AUC(0-t) was 3878.04 (3623.88-5393.09) and 3972.10 (3765.88-5393.02) ng/mL/h, respectively; and the AUC(0-\u221e)was 4610.37 (4315.71-6315.70) and 4728.96 (4502.17-6828.26) ng/mL/h, respectively. There were no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between the 2 formulations.

Patients continued treatment beyond the 12-week end point with monthly monitoring of LFTs. Thirty-six patients who previously discontinued bosentan (n = 31), sitaxsentan (n = 2), or both (n = 3) were enrolled. At baseline, 69.4% of patients were receiving prostanoid and/or sildenafil therapy. No patient had an aminotransferase level more than three times ULN that required ambrisentan discontinuation. One patient had a transient aminotransferase level more than three times ULN that resolved following a temporary dose reduction. No additional aminotransferase levels more than three times ULN were observed with long-term treatment (median exposure, 102 weeks), despite dose increases to 10 mg qd in more than half of the patients.

In this phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, stratified, parallel-group, active-comparator trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of palonosetron versus granisetron for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, both of which were administered with dexamethasone in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. Between July 5, 2006, and May 31, 2007, 1143 patients with cancer who were receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (ie, cisplatin, or an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide combination [AC/EC]) were recruited from 75 institutions in Japan, and randomly assigned to either single-dose palonosetron (0.75 mg), or granisetron (40 microg/kg) 30 min before chemotherapy on day 1, both with dexamethasone (16 mg intravenously) on day 1 followed by additional doses (8 mg intravenously for patients receiving cisplatin or 4 mg orally for patients receiving AC/EC) on days 2 and 3. A non-deterministic minimisation method with a stochastic-biased coin was applied to the randomisation of patients. Covariates known to effect emetic risk, such as sex, age, and type of highly emetogenic chemotherapy, were used as stratification factors of minimisation to ensure balance between the treatment groups. Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with a complete response (defined as no emetic episodes and no rescue medication) during the acute phase (0-24 h postchemotherapy; non-inferiority comparison with granisetron) and the proportion of patients with a complete response during the delayed phase (24-120 h postchemotherapy; superiority comparison with granisetron). The non-inferiority margin was predefined in the study protocol as a 10% difference between groups in the proportion of patients with complete response.

Soluble TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (sTWEAK) and long pentraxin-3 (PTX3) concentrations have been associated with endothelial function in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study tested the hypothesis that the improvement in endothelial function after initiation of angiotensin II receptor blocker (valsartan), calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) therapy, or a combination of both is directly linked to the normalization of sTWEAK and PTX3. One-hundred-eight diabetic CKD stage I patients with hypertension (56% men, 46.7+/-5.3 years) were allocated to a 12-week intervention with amlodipine (10 mg/d), valsartan (160 mg/d), or their combination. Plasma levels of sTWEAK, PTX3, and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) were studied during the interventions. All treatment strategies effectively increased FMD and reduced proteinuria, confirming a more prone reduction with the combined therapy. These improvements were followed by significant PTX3 reductions. Valsartan alone and in combination with amlodipine achieved significant incremental raises in sTWEAK plasma levels. More importantly, the changes observed in sTWEAK (beta=0.25, P=0.006) or PTX3 (beta=-0.24, P=0.007) plasma levels were independently associated with the improvement in ultrasonographically measured FMD. This study shows that treatment with antihypertensive drugs improves FMD and normalizes proteinuria, PTX3, and sTWEAK in diabetic CKD stage I patients with hypertension. The improvement in FMD was independently associated with PTX3 and sTWEAK normalization. Two surrogate biomarkers of endothelial function are therefore identified with potential as therapeutic targets. The study was registered in clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00921570.

To compare cognitive and psychomotor effects of oxymorphone extended release (OM-ER) versus oxycodone controlled release (OC-CR). Randomized, double-blind, 5-way crossover Single inpatient research unit Nondependent recreational opioid users were administered single intact oral tablets of placebo, OM-ER (15 and 30 mg), and OC-CR (30 and 60 mg), separated by a 7- to 21-day washout. The divided attention (DA) test measured psychomotor impairment (e.g., manual tracking [e.g., percentage over road], target accuracy [e.g., target hits], reaction time [hit latency]). Visual analog scales measured alertness/drowsiness, agitation/relaxation, and dizziness. Sedative, stimulant, and dysphoric effects were measured using the Addiction Research Center Inventory Pentobarbital-Chlorpromazine-Alcohol (PCAG), Benzedrine Group (BG), and Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD) scales, respectively. Comparisons were made between equianalgesic doses (OM-ER 15 mg vs OC-CR 30 mg; OM-ER 30 mg vs OC-CR 60 mg), within active drug doses, and between active drugs and placebo using least squares (LS) mean difference of the peak maximum (Emax) or minimum (Emin) effect using linear mixed model analysis of covariance. Thirty-five participants received all 5 treatments. Peak cognitive and psychomotor impairment (LS mean [SE]) was less with OM-ER than equianalgesic doses of OC-CR for reaction time (Emax hit latency, longer if impaired; 571.2 [13.4] vs 588.1 ms [13.4], P=0.03 for OM-ER 15 mg vs OC-CR 30 mg, respectively; 572.4 [13.4] vs 604.3 ms [13.4], P=0.03 for OM-ER 15 mg vs OC-CR 30 mg, respectively; 572.4 [13.4] vs 604.3 ms [13.4], P<0.001 for OM-ER 30 mg vs OC-CR 60 mg, respectively); tracking accuracy (Emin percentage over road, lower if impaired; 71.4 [2.4] vs 65.3 [2.4], P=0.007; 69.9 [2.4] vs 59.4 [2.4], P<0.001), and target accuracy (Emin target hits percentage, lower if impaired; 81.0 [3.1] vs 74.5 [3.1], P=0.02; 79.4 [3.1] vs 66.1 [3.1], P<0.001).

The proportions of patients with valid recanalization (modified Mori grade 2 to 3) at 6 and 24 hours and a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 to 1 and of 0 to 2 at 3 months were compared between the groups dichotomized according to length of the residual vessel. Multiple logistic-regression models were generated to elucidate the predictors of valid recanalization, mRS 0 to 1, and mRS 0 to 2. Receiver operating characteristics analysis revealed that 5 mm was the practical cutoff length for dichotomization. In patients with an M1 length < 5 mm (n = 12), the frequencies of valid recanalization at 6 and 24 hours (16.7% and 25.0%) were significantly lower compared with those (62.1% and 82.8%, respectively) of the 45 patients with a residual M1 length \u2265 5 mm and an M2 occlusion (P = 0.008 for 6 hours, P < 0.001 for 24 hours). The proportions of patients who achieved an mRS of 0 to 1 and an mRS of 0 to 2 were also lower for those with an M1 length < 5 mm (8.3% and 16.7%, respectively) compared with the other group (57.8% and 68.9%, respectively; P = 0.003 for mRS 0 to 1, P = 0.002 for mRS 0 to 2). In logistic-regression models, the site of MCA occlusion (< 5 mm) was a significant predictor of valid recanalization at 6 and 24 hours and of an mRS of 0 to 1 and of mRS of 0 to 2. In patients with acute MCA occlusion, a residual vessel length < 5 mm on magnetic resonance angiography can identify poor responders to 0.6 mg/kg alteplase.

Chronic pain may be a long-term problem related to mesh fixation and operative trauma after Lichtenstein hernioplasty. The aim of this study was to compare the feasibility and safety of tissue cyanoacrylate glue versus absorbable sutures for mesh fixation in Lichtenstein hernioplasty. Lichtenstein hernioplasty was performed under local anaesthesia as a day-case operation in one of three hospitals. The patients were randomized to receive either absorbable polyglycolic acid 3/0 sutures (Dexon(\u00ae); 151 hernias) or 1 ml butyl-2-cyanoacrylate tissue glue (Glubran(\u00ae); 151 hernias) for fixation of lightweight mesh (Optilene(\u00ae)). Wound complications, pain, discomfort and recurrence were identified at 1 and 7 days, 1 month and 1 year after surgery. A total of 302 patients were included in the study. The mean(s.d.) duration of operation was 34(12) min in the glue group and 36(13) min in the suture group (P = 0\u00b7113). The need for analgesics was similar during the first 24 h after surgery. Five wound infections (3\u00b74 per cent) were detected in the glue group and two (1\u00b74 per cent) in the suture group (P = 0\u00b7448). The recurrence rate at 1 year was 1\u00b74 per cent in each group (P = 1\u00b7000). The rates of foreign body sensation, acute and chronic pain were similar in the two groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that the type of mesh fixation did not predict chronic pain 1 year after surgery.

Ciclesonide, an intranasal corticosteroid, is administered as a prodrug and is converted to the active metabolite, desisobutyryl ciclesonide, in the upper and lower airways. Previous studies have assessed systemic exposure with the ciclesonide hydrofluoroalkane metered dose inhaler (CIC HFA-MDI) and the ciclesonide aqueous nasal spray (CIC-AQ) formulations. However, systemic exposure with ciclesonide HFA nasal aerosol (CIC-HFA) developed for the treatment of allergic rhinitis has not been investigated. This study compared the systemic exposure of ciclesonide and desisobutyryl ciclesonide after administration of ciclesonide formulated as an aqueous nasal spray, an HFA nasal aerosol, or as an orally inhaled HFA-MDI. Healthy adults (aged 18-60 years) were randomly assigned in an open-label, singledose, 3-period crossover design to CIC-AQ 300 microg, CIC-HFA 300 microg, or CIC HFA-MDI 320 microg. Serum samples were collected before study drug administration and at 5, 15, and 30 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 22, and 24 hours after dosing. The primary pharmacokinetic parameters were AUC(0-infinity) and C(max) of desisobutyryl ciclesonide. Adverse events were elicited by direct questioning of participants throughout the study. Thirty volunteers were randomly assigned. Most of the volunteers were male (63% [19/30]) and white (83% [25/30]); the mean age was 36 years and mean weight was 68 kg. Concentrations of desisobutyryl ciclesonide were quantifiable (lower limit of quantitation [LLOQ] = 10 ng/L) in the serum samples of only 5 volunteers (of 30) receiving CIC-AQ, and the highest C(max) value of desisobutyryl ciclesonide was 26.7 ng/L (mean C(max), 15.2 ng/L). The AUC(0-infinity) of desisobutyryl ciclesonide for CIC-AQ was below the LLOQ of the bioanalytic assay. Mean C(max) and AUC(0-infinity) of desisobutyryl ciclesonide were 59.1 ng/L and 397.5 ng . h/L, respectively, for CIC-HFA; and 586.2 ng/L and 2685.0 ng . h/L, respectively, for CIC HFA-MDI. Concentrations of the parent compound, ciclesonide, were below the LLOQ in serum samples after administration of CIC-AQ; they were detectable up to 2 hours after administration of CIC-HFA and up to 4 hours after administration of CIC HFA-MDI. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred with a low frequency in all 3 treatment groups (30% [9/30] overall) and were mild in intensity as determined by the study investigator. In this study, compared with that of CIC HFA-MDI, the systemic exposure of desisobutyryl ciclesonide was 10-fold lower after administration of CIC-HFA and at least 40-fold lower after administration of CIC-AQ.

The two primary outcomes were the change in the patient's assessment of global spontaneous hand pain and in hand function (by FIHOA score) from baseline to month 6. Secondary outcomes were improvement in grip strength, duration of morning stiffness, acetaminophen consumption, and the investigator's global impression of treatment efficacy. There was a significantly more pronounced decrease in the patient's global assessment of hand pain in the CS group than in the placebo group (difference VAS scores -8.7 mm; P = 0.016).

Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia is a rare genetic disorder in which both LDL-receptor alleles are defective, resulting in very high concentrations of LDL cholesterol in plasma and premature coronary artery disease. This study investigated whether an antisense inhibitor of apolipoprotein B synthesis, mipomersen, is effective and safe as an adjunctive agent to lower LDL cholesterol concentrations in patients with this disease. This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study was undertaken in nine lipid clinics in seven countries. Patients aged 12 years and older with clinical diagnosis or genetic confirmation of homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, who were already receiving the maximum tolerated dose of a lipid-lowering drug, were randomly assigned to mipomersen 200 mg subcutaneously every week or placebo for 26 weeks. Randomisation was computer generated and stratified by weight (<50 kg vs >/=50 kg) in a centralised blocked randomisation, implemented with a computerised interactive voice response system. All clinical, medical, and pharmacy personnel, and patients were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was percentage change in LDL cholesterol concentration from baseline. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00607373. 34 patients were assigned to mipomersen and 17 to placebo; data for all patients were analysed. 45 patients completed the 26-week treatment period (28 mipomersen, 17 placebo). Mean concentrations of LDL cholesterol at baseline were 11.4 mmol/L (SD 3.6) in the mipomersen group and 10.4 mmol/L (3.7) in the placebo group. The mean percentage change in LDL cholesterol concentration was significantly greater with mipomersen (-24.7%, 95% CI -31.6 to -17.7) than with placebo (-3.3%, -12.1 to 5.5; p=0.0003).

A significantly greater reduction in ADHD-RS-IV total score from baseline to endpoint was also seen in the guanfacine-treated group compared with the placebo group (23.8 vs 11.5, respectively; p < 0.001; effect size = 0.92). A post hoc correlation analysis between percentage reduction from baseline to endpoint in CPRS-R:L oppositional subscale and ADHD-RS-IV total scores indicated that the decreases in oppositional symptoms and ADHD symptoms were highly correlated (r = 0.74). The most commonly reported, treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) in the guanfacine XR group were somnolence (50.7%), headache (22.1%), sedation (13.2%), upper abdominal pain (11.8%) and fatigue (11.0%) and most were mild or moderate in severity. TEAEs of sedation, somnolence or hypersomnia were experienced by 62.5% of subjects in the guanfacine XR group. These events were most common during the dose-titration period but most (63.5%) resolved prior to the taper period. TEAEs of fatigue, lethargy and asthenia were reported in 11.0%, 3.7% and 0.0% of subjects in the guanfacine XR group, respectively. Most subjects receiving guanfacine XR demonstrated modest changes in blood pressure, pulse rate and ECG readings that were not considered clinically significant. In this population of children aged 6-12 years with ADHD and the presence of oppositional symptoms, significant reductions in CPRS-R:L oppositional subscale and ADHD-RS-IV total scores were observed with guanfacine XR treatment compared with placebo. Treatment with guanfacine XR at optimized doses was associated with mostly mild or moderate TEAEs. The findings of this study support the efficacy of guanfacine XR in the treatment of children with ADHD and the presence of oppositional symptoms. NCT00367835.

Vasomotor symptoms and bone loss are complications frequently induced by adjuvant treatment for breast cancer. Tibolone prevents both side-effects, but its effect on cancer recurrence is unknown. The aim of this study was to show non-inferiority of tibolone to placebo regarding risk of recurrence in breast-cancer patients with climacteric complaints. Between July 11, 2002, and Dec 20, 2004, women surgically treated for a histologically confirmed breast cancer (T(1-3)N(0-2)M(0)) with vasomotor symptoms were randomly assigned to either tibolone 2.5 mg daily or placebo at 245 centres in 31 countries. Randomisation was done by use of a centralised interactive voice response system, stratified by centre, with a block size of four. The primary endpoint was breast-cancer recurrence, including contralateral breast cancer, and was analysed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol populations; the margin for non-inferiority was set as a hazard ratio of 1.278. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00408863. Of the 3148 women randomised, 3098 were included in the ITT analysis (1556 in the tibolone group and 1542 in the placebo group).

The final pharmacokinetic parameters were as follows: ganciclovir clearance (CL) was 7.49.(CL(CR)/57) liter/h (57 was the mean population value of CL(CR)); the central and peripheral distribution volumes were 31.9 liters and 32.0 liters, respectively; intercompartmental clearance was 10.2 liter/h; the first-order absorption rate constant was 0.895 h(-1); bioavailability was 0.825; and lag time was 0.382 h. The CL(CR) was the best predictor of CL, making dose adjustment by this covariate important to achieve the most efficacious ganciclovir exposure.

The potential therapeutic utility of estrogens in schizophrenia is increasingly being recognized. Raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, appears to act similarly to conjugated estrogens on dopamine and serotonin brain systems and may be a better option since it lacks the possible negative effects of estrogen on breast and uterine tissue. In this study, we assess the utility of raloxifene as an adjunctive treatment for negative symptoms and other psychotic symptoms in postmenopausal women with schizophrenia. This was a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients were recruited from both the inpatient and outpatient departments of Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de D\u00e9u, Barcelona, Spain, and Corporaci\u00f3 Sanit\u00e0ria Parc Taul\u00ed, Sabadell, Spain. Thirty-three postmenopausal women with schizophrenia (DSM-IV criteria) who exhibited prominent negative symptoms were randomized to either adjunctive raloxifene (16 women; mean age = 60.14 years, SD = 6.41 years) or adjunctive placebo (17 women; mean age = 62.66 years, SD = 4.54 years) for 12 weeks. The period of recruitment lasted from January 2005 through June 2009. Psychopathological symptoms were assessed at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12 by means of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. The addition of raloxifene (60 mg/d) to regular antipsychotic treatment significantly reduced negative (P = .044), positive (P = .031), and general psychopathological (P = .045) symptoms during the 12-week trial as compared with women receiving placebo. Raloxifene as an adjuvant treatment in postmenopausal women with schizophrenia who exhibit prominent negative symptoms appears to be useful in improving negative, positive, and general psychopathological symptoms. If more extensive and longer-term studies confirm and expand upon these positive results, the use of raloxifene could be recommended in postmenopausal patients with schizophrenia. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01041092.

Previous human studies have shown low activity of protein C (APC) in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). This, together with the findings in animal models, suggests that activated protein C (APC) may protect against pancreatic injury and ameliorate the disease. We, therefore, evaluated its effect on multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) measured by the SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) and on organ-failure-free days, and the safety of APC in SAP. A prospective double blind randomized pilot study was use. The study occurred in one university hospital tertiary intensive care unit (ICU) with eight beds. The patients were chosen according to the following inclusion criteria: 1) Those admitted to the hospital < 96 h from the onset of pain, 2) Those who had a three-fold increase in serum amylase over normal upper range or/and in whom computed tomography (CT) verification of SAP was noted, 3) Those who had one or more organ dysfunction (OD), and 4) Those in whom less than 48 hours had passed since their first OD. Of a total of 215 adult patients with SAP screened between June 2003 and August 2007, 158 fulfilled the study inclusion criteria. After exclusions 32 patients were randomized to the study. The intervention consisted of APC (N = 16) administered intravenously for 96 hours with a dose of 24 \u03bcg/kg/hour or placebo (N = 16) with a similar infusion rate. The sample size for the study was calculated according to the primary end-point: the change in SOFA during study drug infusion (Days 0 and 5). Comparisons between the study groups were performed using patient-related changes and calculation of difference in means (DIM, 95% CIs) and regarding categorical variables with Fisher's exact test.

Between 9 July 2007 and 19 June 2009, a randomized, non-inferiority (10% difference threshold in efficacy at day 28) clinical trial was carried out at 12 sites in seven sub-Saharan African countries. Each site compared three of four ACTs, namely amodiaquine-artesunate (ASAQ), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAPQ), artemether-lumefantrine (AL), or chlorproguanil-dapsone-artesunate (CD+A). Overall, 4,116 children 6-59 mo old with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria were treated (1,226 with AL, 1,002 with ASAQ, 413 with CD+A, and 1,475 with DHAPQ), actively followed up until day 28, and then passively followed up for the next 6 mo.

In a multicentre, phase II, double-blind, parallel-group trial, patients were randomised to receive PLC 1 g/day, PLC 2 g/day or placebo. Main inclusion criteria were as follows: age 18-75; disease activity index (DAI) score 3-10 inclusive, be under oral stable treatment with aminosalicylate or thiopurine. The primary endpoint was clinical/endoscopic response, defined as a decrease in DAI score \u2265 3 points or remission, defined as a DAI score \u2264 2 with no individual sub-score > 1. Of 121 patients who were randomised, 57 of 79 (72%) patients receiving PLC (combined 1 g and 2 g cohort) had a clinical/endoscopic response vs. 20 of 40 (50%) receiving placebo (P = 0.02). Specifically, in PLC 1 g/day group, 30 of 40 (75%) patients had clinical/endoscopic response (P = 0.02 vs. placebo) and 27 of 39 (69%) in the PLC 2 g/day group (P = 0.08 vs. placebo). Rates of remission were 22/40 (55%), 19/39 (49%), 14/40 (35%) in the PLC 1 g, PLC 2 g, and placebo groups, respectively. PLC had a similar safety profile to placebo; the most common adverse events were gastrointestinal.

To evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, effectiveness, impact on quality of life, and medication satisfaction of sumatriptan/naproxen sodium in the acute treatment of migraine headache in adolescents. This 12-month, multicenter, open-label, safety study was conducted in adolescents (aged 12-17 years) with an average of 2-8 migraines/month typically lasting >2 hours untreated for >6 months prior to initiation. Subjects were instructed to treat migraines as early as possible and were allowed to rescue 2 hours post dose with a single dose of a naproxen-containing product, over-the-counter pain reliever, or anti-emetics. Subjects were advised not to take a second tablet of sumatriptan/naproxen sodium without at least a 24-hour headache-free period. Safety evaluations included adverse events, laboratory tests, and vital signs and electrocardiogram evaluation. Other evaluations included freedom from pain, quality of life, and medication satisfaction. Of the 656 subjects enrolled, 622 (95%) treated at least 1 migraine with sumatriptan/naproxen sodium, of which 435 (70%) and 363 (58%) completed 6 and 12 months of the study, respectively. Overall, there were 12,927 exposures to sumatriptan/naproxen sodium: on average 2.5 tablets were taken per month per subject. The most common treatment-related adverse events were nausea (7%), dizziness (3%), muscle tightness (3%), and chest discomfort (3%). There were no deaths; 4 subjects had 5 serious adverse events (suicide attempt, hemolytic anemia and syncope, suicidal ideation, spontaneous abortion) unrelated to sumatriptan/naproxen sodium and resolved without sequelae. Seven percent of subjects discontinued participation in the study because of an adverse event; 5% of subjects discontinued due to lack of efficacy. Overall, 42% of the migraine attacks were pain-free within 2 hours of treatment with sumatriptan/naproxen sodium, subjects reported improvements from baseline in 2 of 3 quality of life domains over time, and were generally satisfied with the efficacy and overall treatment at the end of the study. In adolescent migraineurs, after up to 12 months and over 12,000 exposures to sumatriptan/naproxen sodium, there were no new or clinically significant findings in the safety parameters, including the frequency and nature of adverse events, as compared to the individual components or to the adverse event profile in adults.

Since current treatment options for patients suffering from active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remain inadequate, especially for those unresponsive to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), new and improved medication is needed. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of masitinib (AB1010), a potent and selective protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor of c-KIT, in the monotherapy treatment of DMARD-refractory RA. This was a multicentre, uncontrolled, open-label, randomised, dose-ranging, phase 2a trial. Masitinib was administered orally to 43 patients who had inadequate response to DMARDs, at initial randomised dosing levels of 3 and 6 mg/kg per day over a 12-week period. Dose adjustment was permitted based upon tolerability and response criteria. Efficacy was assessed via American College of Rheumatology 20%/50%/70% improvement criteria (ACR20/50/70) responses, disease activity score using 28 joint counts (DAS28), index of improvement in RA (ACRn) and C-reactive protein (CRP) improvement, relative to baseline at week 12. Improvement was observed in all efficacy endpoints, including ACR20/50/70 scores of 54%, 26% and 8%, respectively, and a reduction in CRP level by greater than 50% for approximately half the population. This improvement was sustainable throughout an extension phase (> 84 weeks) and was also independent of initial DMARD resistance (anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha and/or methotrexate). A relatively high patient withdrawal rate (37%) required the use of last observation carried forward (LOCF) data imputation. Incidence of adverse events was high (95%), although the majority were of mild or moderate severity with a considerable decline in frequency observed after 12 weeks of treatment. Two nonfatal serious adverse events were reported. Dose-response analyses tentatively indicate that an initial dosing level of 6.0 mg/kg per day administered orally in two daily intakes is the most appropriate, based upon potency and tolerability trends. Treatment with masitinib improved DMARD-refractory active RA. Following an initial high incidence of mostly mild to moderate side effects during the first 12 weeks of treatment, masitinib appears to be generally well tolerated. This, together with evidence of a sustainable efficacy response, suggests that masitinib is suitable for long-term treatment regimens. Since this was the first study of masitinib in a nononcologic pathology, the relatively high patient withdrawal rate observed can be partly attributed to a highly cautious response to adverse events. There is sufficient compelling evidence to warrant further placebo-controlled investigation. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00831922.

Bridging of the correlate of protection established in the young adult population to the older adult immunogenicity data demonstrated the likely effectiveness of the Vero-derived vaccine in the older adult population. A Vero cell culture-derived seasonal influenza vaccine is safe, immunogenic and protects against infection with influenza virus. The novel vaccine technology has the potential to make a substantial contribution to improving influenza vaccine supply.

Patients underwent stratification according to age (6-11 years [N = 111] or 12-17 years [N = 90]) and were assigned randomly to receive treatment with the study drug or placebo (in a 2:1 ratio). The primary efficacy variable was latency to persistent sleep between weeks 3 and 6. Secondary efficacy variables also were assessed, and behavioral and cognitive components of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were monitored. Safety was assessed on the basis of reports of adverse events, abnormal laboratory data, vital signs, and physical examination findings. The potential for next-day residual effects also was assessed. The baseline-adjusted mean change in latency to persistent sleep at week 4 did not differ significantly between the zolpidem and placebo groups (-20.28 vs -21.27 minutes). However, differences favoring zolpidem were observed for the older age group in Clinical Global Impression scores at weeks 4 and 8. No next-day residual effects of treatment were associated with zolpidem, and no rebound phenomena occurred after treatment discontinuation. Central nervous system and psychiatric disorders were the most-frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (>5%) that were observed more frequently with zolpidem than with placebo; these included dizziness, headache, and hallucinations. Ten (7.4%) patients discontinued zolpidem treatment because of adverse events. Zolpidem at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg per day to a maximum of 10 mg failed to reduce the latency to persistent sleep on polysomnographic recordings after 4 weeks of treatment in children and adolescents 6 through 17 years of age who had attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-associated insomnia.

Prediction of ovarian response prior to the first controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) cycle is useful in determining the optimal starting dose of recombinant FSH (rFSH). However, potentially predictive factors may be subject to inter-cycle variability and many patients are pre-treated with oral contraceptives (OC) for scheduling purposes. Our objective was to determine predictive factors of ovarian response for patients undergoing COS with rFSH in a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist protocol and to determine the inter-cycle variability of these factors. In this multinational trial, 442 patients were randomized to receive either OC treatment or no treatment prior to their first COS cycle. For candidate predictive factors, patient characteristics were collected at screening, and endocrine and sonographic data were collected during the early follicular phase of the two subsequent cycles. A treatment regimen of 200 IU rFSH and 0.25 mg ganirelix was applied during the second cycle. Predictive factors of ovarian response and of too low (<6 oocytes) or too high (>18 oocytes) ovarian responses were determined using stepwise linear regression and stepwise logistic regression, respectively. Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) and basal FSH were statistically significant predictors of the number of oocytes retrieved and of an excessive ovarian response. For low ovarian response, AMH was the only significant predictive factor. In the non-OC group, the predictive value was higher than in the OC group and higher at the early follicular phase of the stimulation cycle than of the previous cycle. The inter-cycle variation for AMH was low compared with the inter-cycle variation of other hormones. Between the two groups, there were no differences in the number or quality of embryos obtained or transferred, but the implantation rate was significantly lower in the OC group (24.1 versus 30.1%, P= 0.03), resulting in an ongoing pregnancy rate of 26.3% compared with 35.7% in the non-OC group (P= 0.05). The best predictive model of ovarian response was in the non-OC group and included both AMH and basal FSH determined at the early follicular phase of the stimulation cycle. In the proceeding cycle, AMH alone had sufficient predictive value since it was not affected by inter-cycle variability or OC pretreatment.

Twelve subjects in the vigabatrin group and two subjects in the placebo group maintained abstinence through the follow-up period. The retention rate was 62.0% in the vigabatrin arm versus 41.5% in the placebo arm. Among subjects who reported prestudy alcohol use, vigabatrin, relative to placebo, was associated with superior self-reported full end-of-trial abstinence from alcohol (43.5% versus 6.3%). There were no differences between the two groups in drug craving, depressed mood, anxiety, or Clinical Global Impression scores, and no group differences in adverse effects emerged. This first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial supports the safety and efficacy of short-term vigabatrin treatment of cocaine dependence.

Open fractures are an important source of morbidity and are associated with delayed union, nonunion, and infection. Preventing infection through meticulous irrigation and debridement is an important goal in management, and different lavage fluids and irrigation techniques (e.g., high- or low-pressure lavage) have been described for this purpose. However, there are a limited number of randomized trials comparing irrigating solutions or irrigating technique. We compared the use of castile soap versus normal saline and high- versus low-pressure pulsatile lavage on the rates of reoperations and complications in patients with open fracture wounds. We conducted a multicenter, blinded, randomized 2 \u00d7 2 factorial pilot trial of 111 patients in whom an open fracture wound was treated with either castile soap solution or normal saline and either high- or low-pressure pulsatile lavage. The primary composite outcome of reoperation, measured at 12 months after initial operative procedure, included infection, wound healing problems, and nonunion. Planned reoperations were not included. Secondary outcomes included all infection, all wound healing problems, and nonunion as well as functional outcomes scores (EuroQol-5 dimensions and short form-12). Eighty-nine patients completed the 1-year follow-up. Among all patients, 13 (23%) in the castile soap group and 13 (24%) in the saline group had a primary outcome event (hazard ratio, 0.91, 95% confidence interval: 0.42-2.00, p = 0.52). Sixteen patients (28%) in the high-pressure group and 10 patients (19%) in the low-pressure group had a primary outcome event (hazard ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval: 0.24-1.27, p = 0.17). Functional outcome scores showed no significant differences at any time point between groups. The fluid lavage of open wounds pilot randomized controlled trial demonstrated the possibility that the use of low pressure may decrease the reoperation rate for infection, wound healing problems, or nonunion.

The primary endpoint, change in eGFR from Day 0 to Month 6, was 2.48 \u00b1 0.95 ml/min/1.73 m2 with EC-MPS 1,440 mg and -0.48 \u00b1 0.93 ml/min/1.73 m2 with EC-MPS 720 mg (difference 2.96 ml/min/1.73 m2; 95% CI 0.32 - 5.60; p = 0.028). There were no deaths, graft losses or acute rejections. Adverse events were more frequent with EC-MPS 1,440 mg than 720 mg (66.7% vs. 44.7%, p = 0.034). Adverse events with suspected relation to EC-MPS occurred in 26.7% and 21.3% of patients, respectively (p = 0.59). Conversion of kidney transplant patients to increased MPA dosing using EC-MPS 1,440 mg/d, with reduced tacrolimus exposure, appears an effective immunosuppression strategy and may improve renal function. Adverse events overall, but not those with a suspected relation to EC-MPS, were higher with ECMPS 1,440 mg/d.

Forty-five women with ICS stage 2 or higher pelvic organ prolapse (POP) were enrolled at 4 centers. POP-Q, pelvic floor function (PFDI-20), sexual function (PISQ-12), and patient satisfaction tools were used to assess subjects at baseline, and at 2 and 6 weeks, and 3, 6 and 12 months post surgery. The significance of symptom score changes at 6 months and 1 year were determined by the t-test for paired data. Forty-three of the 45 patients completed the 12 month study. The majority of the subjects had cystocele (98%) and/or rectocele (84%) defects at study entry. At 12 months, 74% of the defects had improved to a stage 0 or 1. Mean PFDI-20 scores improved by 72% (p < 0.001) at 12 months, and PISQ-12 scores were maintained during the follow-up period indicating no decline in sexual function. Three subjects experienced one serious adverse event each; one of the adverse events (constipation) was deemed by the study physician to be unrelated to Xenform\u00ae. One subject had severe pyelonephritis resulting in dialysis. This subject had a previous history of pyelonephritis, sepsis and acute renal failure. The third subject had a reported recurrent cystocele of moderate severity, possibly related to the device. No graft related erosions or pain lasting more than 30 days were reported. No subjects withdrew due to an adverse event. This study is the first to investigate the use of Xenform\u00ae Matrix in vaginal reconstructive surgery among patients with POP.

We aimed to compare the ability of different partner drugs to preserve chloroquine efficacy and prevent the re-emergence of resistance. Children with uncomplicated malaria were enrolled at a government health center in Blantyre, Malawi. Participants were randomized to receive chloroquine alone or combined with artesunate, azithromycin or atovaquone-proguanil for all episodes of uncomplicated malaria for one year. The primary outcome was incidence of clinical malaria. Secondary endpoints included treatment efficacy, and incidence of the chloroquine resistance marker pfcrt T76 and of anemia. Of the 640 children enrolled, 628 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Malaria incidence (95% confidence interval) was 0.59 (.46-.74), .61 (.49-.76), .63 (.50-.79) and .68 (.54-.86) episodes/person-year for group randomized to receive chloroquine alone or in combination with artesunate, azithromycin or atovaquone-proguanil respectively and the differences were not statistically significant. Treatment efficacy for first episodes was 100% for chloroquine monotherapy and 97.9% for subsequent episodes of malaria. Similar results were seen in each of the chloroquine combination groups. The incidence of pfcrt T76 in pure form was 0%; mixed infections with both K76 and T76 were found in two out of 911 infections. Young children treated with chloroquine-azithromycin had higher hemoglobin concentrations at the study's end than did those in the chloroquine monotherapy group.

This phase I/II trial was performed to evaluate safety, tolerability, recommended phase II dose (RD) and early signs of activity of L19-IL2. Five cohorts of patients with progressive solid tumours (n=21) received an intravenous infusion of L19-IL2 (from 5 to 30 Mio IU IL2 equivalent dose) on days 1, 3 and 5 every 3 weeks. This treatment cycle was repeated up to six times. In the following expansion phase, patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (n=12) were treated at the RD of L19-IL2. Clinical data and laboratory findings were analysed for safety, tolerability and activity. Preclinical studies in rats and monkeys did not raise any safety concerns. The RD was defined to be 22.5 Mio IU IL2 equivalent. Pharmacokinetics of L19-IL2 was dose proportional over the tested range, with a terminal half-life of 2-3h. Toxicities were manageable and reversible with no treatment-related deaths. We observed stable disease in 17/33 patients (51%) and 15/18 with mRCC (83%) after two cycles.

Patients requiring surgery for an isolated hip fracture of less than 48 h received saline or tranexamic acid 15 mg kg(-1) given at skin incision and 3 h later. Primary efficacy outcome was erythrocyte transfusion from surgery up to day 8. Transfusion was administered according to a standardized protocol (Hb<9 g dl(-1)). Safety criterion was a composite of symptomatic and asymptomatic vascular events up to 6 weeks. Fifty-seven patients were randomized to tranexamic acid and 53 to placebo. The rate of erythrocyte transfusion was 42% with tranexamic acid and 60% with placebo (P=0.06). Preoperative haemoglobin value, age, and type of surgery were risk factors for erythrocyte transfusion independent of treatment group. The probability of vascular events at 6 weeks was 16% in the tranexamic acid group and 6% in the placebo group (P=0.10). A meta-analysis combining this study with previous trials showed that tranexamic acid significantly reduced erythrocyte transfusion in hip fracture surgery although efficacy was lower than that observed in hip or knee arthroplasty.

The VAPI questionnaire was developed based on interviews with vaccinees. The initial version was administered to subjects in international clinical trials comparing intradermal with intramuscular influenza vaccination. Item reduction and scale construction were carried out using principal component and multitrait analyses (n = 549). Psychometric validation of the final version was conducted per country (n = 5,543) and included construct and clinical validity and internal consistency reliability. All subjects gave their written informed consent before being interviewed or included in the clinical studies. The final questionnaire comprised 4 dimensions (\"bother from ISR\"; \"arm movement\"; \"sleep\"; \"acceptability\") grouping 16 items, and 5 individual items (anxiety before vaccination; bother from pain during vaccination; satisfaction with injection system; willingness to be vaccinated next year; anxiety about vaccination next year). Construct validity was confirmed for all scales in most of the countries. Internal consistency reliability was good for all versions (Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.68 to 0.94), as was clinical validity: scores were positively correlated with the severity of ISR and pain.

The majority of treated hypertensive patients do not achieve target blood pressure (BP) levels of less than 140/90 mmHg. One key reason is inadequate adherence with the prescribed drug regimen. Dosing regimens are either not executed as prescribed (noncompliance) or patients stop taking the medication (nonpersistence). It has been demonstrated that adherence with angiotensin receptor antagonists such as valsartan is high due to the tolerability profile of this drug class. The present study was designed to evaluate whether drug adherence could further be improved by the use of supportive measures. Twenty-eight centers were randomized to provide pharmacological treatment with or without a set of supportive measures (e.g. structured physician-patient interaction, printed information about hypertension, reminder stickers, 24 h timer, and home BP measurement device). Two hundred and two patients with grade 1 hypertension (BP at baseline 149.8 +/- 6.2/93.9 +/- 4.4 mmHg) who were either newly diagnosed or who had not been treated for at least 1 year were included in this trial.

Patients treated with a valsartan-based therapy receiving supportive measures as compared with the standard care group demonstrated an initially higher level of adherence with a maximum absolute difference of 7.8% (P = 0.041). This difference did not persist over the observation period but faded with time. In parallel, execution of the dosing regimen (compliance) was also improved in the intervention group during the early months of treatment but this effect also disappeared by the end of the observation period.

To determine whether HFCWC with higher pressure settings (6-10 on the Hill-Rom Vest's arbitrary 1-10 scale) combined with variable mid-frequencies (8, 9, and 10 Hz, plus 18, 19, and 20 Hz) (higher-pressure/variable-frequency HFCWC) results in greater sputum expectoration than lower-pressure/mid-frequency HFCWC. This was a controlled randomized crossover study. Sixteen clinically stable, adult CF patients participated. Patients performed airway clearance with HFCWC, once each with lower-pressure/mid-frequency HFCWC and higher-pressure/variable-frequency HFCWC, on separate occasions. All sputum produced during each session was collected. Patients completed pulmonary function tests before and after each session. Median sputum wet weight was greater with higher-pressure/variable-frequency HFCWC than with lower-pressure/mid-frequency HFCWC (6.4 g, range 0.49-22.0 g, versus 4.8 g, range 0.24-15.0 g, P = .02). Dry sputum weight differences did not reach statistical significance (higher-pressure/variable-frequency HFCWC 0.20 g, range 0.009-0.62 g, lower-pressure/mid-frequency HFCWC 0.12 g, range 0.0001-1.0 g, P = .23). Higher-pressure/variable-frequency HFCWC and lower-pressure/mid-frequency HFCWC resulted in similar increases in FEV(1) (70 mL vs 90 mL, P = .21) and forced vital capacity (80 mL vs 80 mL, P = .94). Post-therapy sputum viscoelastic properties did not differ. Patients perceived the 2 regimens as equally comfortable and effective (P = .35 and P = .35, respectively). In adult CF patients, single-session higher-pressure/variable-frequency HFCWC resulted in greater sputum expectoration by wet weight, but not other differences, compared to the commonly used lower-pressure/mid-frequency settings. Longer-term comparisons are needed in a larger, more diverse population to determine whether sustained use of the higher-pressure/variable-frequency settings results in clinically important differences in outcomes.

To evaluate whether patients with very stable INR results should continue with the maintenance dose of warfarin without a single-dose correction, even when the result unexpectedly is moderately below or above the therapeutic range. A) We reviewed retrospectively 364 patients with unchanged maintenance dose for at least 6 months and an occasional INR outside the therapeutic range regarding decision on dosing and the effect on the next INR.

Follow-up INRs and telephone interviews were obtained after 2 weeks. A) Retrospectively, the proportion of follow-up INRs outside the therapeutic range was 29.9% after No change, 27.1% after Increased dose and 25.7% after Skipped/reduced dose. However, the decision on No change was mainly taken in case of minimal INR deviations.

However, low-dose treatment may improve insulin sensitivity, although data in humans with detailed metabolic phenotyping are as yet not available. We postulated that long-term low-dose growth hormone replacement, restoring IGF-1 to the low-normal range, might beneficially affect glucose metabolism.

This study sought to determine the effects of a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, losmapimod, on vascular inflammation, by (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade plays an important role in the initiation and progression of inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis. Patients with atherosclerosis on stable statin therapy (n = 99) were randomized to receive losmapimod 7.5 mg once daily (lower dose [LD]), twice daily (higher dose [HD]) or placebo for 84 days. Vascular inflammation was assessed by FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging of the carotid arteries and aorta; analyses focused on the index vessel (the artery with the highest average maximum tissue-to-background ratio [TBR] at baseline). Serum inflammatory biomarkers and FDG uptake in visceral and subcutaneous fat were also measured. The primary endpoint, change from baseline in average TBR across all segments in the index vessel, was not significantly different between HD and placebo (\u0394TBR: -0.04 [95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.14 to +0.06], p = 0.452) or LD and placebo (\u0394TBR: -0.02 [95% CI: -0.11 to +0.06], p = 0.579). However, there was a statistically significant reduction in average TBR in active segments (TBR \u22651.6) (HD vs. placebo: \u0394TBR: -0.10 [95% CI: -0.19 to -0.02], p = 0.0125; LD vs. placebo: \u0394TBR: -0.10 [95% CI: -0.18 to -0.02], p = 0.0194). The probability of a segment being active was also significantly reduced for HD when compared with placebo (OR: 0.57 [95% CI: 0.41 to 0.81], p = 0.002). Within the HD group, reductions were observed in placebo-corrected inflammatory biomarkers including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (% reduction: -28% [95% CI: -46 to -5], p = 0.023) as well as FDG uptake in visceral fat (\u0394SUV: -0.05 [95% CI: -0.09 to -0.01], p = 0.018), but not subcutaneous fat. Despite nonsignificant changes for the primary endpoint of average vessel TBR, HD losmapimod reduced vascular inflammation in the most inflamed regions, concurrent with a reduction in inflammatory biomarkers and FDG uptake in visceral fat. These results suggest a systemic anti-inflammatory effect. (A Study to Evaluate the Effects of 3 Months Dosing With GW856553, as Assessed FDG-PET/CT Imaging; NCT00633022).

Efficacy and safety data were pooled from 12 studies (n=6151). These were 6- to 96-week randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo- or active-controlled trials with lapaquistat monotherapy or coadministration with other lipid-altering drugs in dyslipidemic patients, including a large (n=2121) 96-week safety study. All studies included lapaquistat 100 mg daily; 5 included 50 mg; and 1 included 25 mg. The main outcome measures were the percent change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, secondary lipid/metabolic parameters, and overall safety. Lapaquistat 100 mg significantly decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 21.6% in monotherapy and by 18.0% in combination with a statin. It also reduced other cardiovascular risk markers, such as C-reactive protein. Total adverse events were higher for lapaquistat than placebo, although individual events were generally similar. At 100 mg, there was an increase in alanine aminotransferase value \u22653 times the upper limit of normal on \u22652 consecutive visits (2.0% versus 0.3% for placebo in the pooled efficacy studies; 2.7% versus 0.7% for low-dose atorvastatin in the long-term study). Two patients receiving lapaquistat 100 mg met the Hy Law criteria of alanine aminotransferase elevation plus increased total bilirubin. Squalene synthase inhibition with lapaquistat acetate, alone or in combination with statins, effectively lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner. Elevations in alanine aminotransferase, combined with a rare increase in bilirubin, presented potential hepatic safety issues, resulting in termination of development.

Every participant received each test dose under the three buprenorphine maintenance dose conditions. Intravenous buprenorphine/naloxone was self-administered less frequently than buprenorphine or heroin (P < 0.0005). Participants were most likely to self-administer drug intravenously when maintained on the lowest sublingual buprenorphine dose. Subjective ratings of 'drug liking' and 'desire to take the drug again' were lower for buprenorphine/naloxone than for buprenorphine or heroin (P = 0.0001). Participants reported that they would pay significantly less money for buprenorphine/naloxone than for buprenorphine or heroin (P < 0.05).

In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, we supplemented the diets of overweight Chinese men with 250\u00a0mL of fruit juice that contained NUTRIOSE (Test group: n = 60, age = 30.4\u00a0\u00b1 4.3\u00a0years, body mass index (BMI) = 24.5\u00a0\u00b1 0.2\u00a0kg\u00b7m-2) or a maltodextrin placebo ( n = 60, age = 31.6\u00a0\u00b1 4.1\u00a0years, BMI = 24.5\u00a0\u00b1 0.3\u00a0kg\u00b7m-2) at a dosage of 17 g twice daily for 12\u00a0weeks. Daily caloric intake, body composition, blood chemistry, and blood pressure were evaluated every 4\u00a0weeks during the trial. Test subjects consumed fewer calories per day and had greater reductions in body weight, BMI, body fat percentage, and waist circumference than Control subjects. All markers of glucose metabolism improved in the Test group, with increases in adiponectin and reductions in glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance, glycosylated hemoglobin, and glycated albumin (all p\u00a0< 0.01). Similarly, all lipid measures improved with increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and reductions in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides (all p\u00a0< 0.01). No changes were observed in systolic blood pressure between groups. Most components of glucose metabolism and the lipid profile were significantly better in the Test than in the Control subjects. No adverse events or gastrointestinal complaints were reported in either group. Supplementation with NUTRIOSE for 12\u00a0weeks is well tolerated, lowers insulin resistance, and improves determinants of metabolic syndrome in overweight men.

Insomnia is a major health problem with significant psychological, health, and economic consequences. However, availability of one of the most effective insomnia treatments, cognitive behavioral therapy, is significantly limited. The Internet may be a key conduit for delivering this intervention. To evaluate the efficacy of a structured behavioral Internet intervention for adults with insomnia. Forty-five adults were randomly assigned to an Internet intervention (n = 22) or wait-list control group (n = 23). Forty-four eligible participants (mean [SD] age, 44.86 [11.03] years; 34 women) who had a history of sleep difficulties longer than 10 years on average (mean [SD], 10.59 [8.89] years) were included in the analyses. The Internet intervention is based on well-established face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy incorporating the primary components of sleep restriction, stimulus control, sleep hygiene, cognitive restructuring, and relapse prevention. The Insomnia Severity Index and daily sleep diary data were used to determine changes in insomnia severity and the main sleep variables, including wake after sleep onset and sleep efficiency. Intention-to-treat analyses showed that scores on the Insomnia Severity Index significantly improved from 15.73 (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.07 to 17.39) to 6.59 (95% CI, 4.73 to 8.45) for the Internet group but did not change for the control group (16.27 [95% CI, 14.61 to 17.94] to 15.50 [95% CI, 13.64 to 17.36]) (F(1,42) = 29.64; P < .001). The Internet group maintained their gains at the 6-month follow-up. Internet participants also achieved significant decreases in wake after sleep onset (55% [95% CI, 34% to 76%]) and increases in sleep efficiency (16% [95% CI, 9% to 22%]) compared with the nonsignificant control group changes of wake after sleep onset (8% [95% CI, -17% to 33%) and sleep efficiency (3%; 95% CI, -4% to 9%).

Patients received either placebo or linaclotide, 145 \u03bcg or 290 \u03bcg, once daily for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was three or more complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) per week and an increase of one or more CSBMs from baseline during at least 9 of the 12 weeks. Adverse events were also monitored. For Trials 303 and 01, respectively, the primary end point was reached by 21.2% and 16.0% of the patients who received 145 \u03bcg of linaclotide and by 19.4% and 21.3% of the patients who received 290 \u03bcg of linaclotide, as compared with 3.3% and 6.0% of those who received placebo (P<0.01 for all comparisons of linaclotide with placebo).

The molecular mechanisms by which thiazolidinediones improve insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes are not fully understood. We hypothesised that pioglitazone would activate the adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and increase the expression of genes involved in adiponectin signalling, NEFA oxidation and mitochondrial function in human skeletal muscle. A randomised, double-blind, parallel study was performed in 26 drug-naive type 2 diabetes patients treated with: (1) pioglitazone (n = 14) or (2) aggressive nutritional therapy (n = 12) to reduce HbA(1c) to levels observed in the pioglitazone-treated group. Participants were assigned randomly to treatment using a table of random numbers. Before and after 6 months, patients reported to the Clinical Research Center of the Texas Diabetes Institute for a vastus lateralis muscle biopsy followed by a 180 min euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic (80 mU m(-2) min(-1)) clamp. All patients in the pioglitazone (n = 14) or nutritional therapy (n = 12) group were included in the analysis. Pioglitazone significantly increased plasma adiponectin concentration by 79% and reduced fasting plasma NEFA by 35% (both p < 0.01). Following pioglitazone, insulin-stimulated glucose disposal increased by 30% (p < 0.01), and muscle AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation increased by 38% and 53%, respectively (p < 0.05). Pioglitazone increased mRNA levels for adiponectin receptor 1 and 2 genes (ADIPOR1, ADIPOR2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1 gene (PPARGC1) and multiple genes involved in mitochondrial function and fat oxidation. Despite a similar reduction in HbA(1c) and similar improvement in insulin sensitivity with nutritional therapy, there were no significant changes in muscle AMPK and ACC phosphorylation, or the expression of ADIPOR1, ADIPOR2, PPARGC1 and genes involved in mitochondrial function and fat oxidation. No adverse (or unexpected) effects or side effects were reported from the study. Pioglitazone increases plasma adiponectin levels, stimulates muscle AMPK signalling and increases the expression of genes involved in adiponectin signalling, mitochondrial function and fat oxidation. These changes may represent an important cellular mechanism by which thiazolidinediones improve skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity.

This Phase II, multicenter, open-label study compared the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tolerability of anagrelide and its active metabolite, 3-hydroxy-anagrelide, in young and elderly patients with ET. Three days prior to pharmacokinetic assessment, patients divided their normal daily anagrelide into a structured twice-daily dosing (BID) schedule. Serial blood samples were obtained for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis over a 12-h dosing interval. Anagrelide and 3-hydroxy-anagrelide plasma concentrations were normalized to a common dose (1 mg BID) to control for dosing differences between patients. Patients were monitored routinely for adverse events (AEs) and vital signs. A total of 24 patients (12 young; 12 elderly) completed the study. The dose-normalized anagrelide maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve over one dosing interval (AUC\u03c4), were higher in elderly patients compared with young patients (Cmax: 3.63 vs. 2.66 ng/ml; p = 0.09, AUC\u03c4: 10.3 vs. 6.4 ng\u00d7h/ml; p = 0.01).

Identifying patients prior to treatment who are more likely to benefit from chemotherapeutic agents or more likely to experience adverse events is an aim of personalized medicine. Pharmacogenomics offers a potential means of achieving this goal through the discovery of predictive germline genetic biomarkers. When applied particularly to the treatment of head and neck cancers, such information could offer significant benefit to patients as a means of potentially reducing morbidity associated with platinum-based chemotherapy. We developed a genome-wide, cell-based approach to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with platinum susceptibility and then evaluated these SNPs as predictors for response and toxicity in head and neck cancer patients treated with platinum-based therapy as part of a phase II clinical trial. Sixty head and neck cancer patients were evaluated. Of 45 genome-wide SNPs examined, we found that 2 SNPs, rs6870861 (P=0.004; false discovery rate [FDR] <0.05) and rs2551038 (P=0.005; FDR <0.05), were associated significantly with overall response to carboplatin-based induction chemotherapy when incorporated into a model along with total carboplatin exposure.

Between July 1, 2001, and Dec 10, 2005, a series of 106 patients with 183 lung tumours that were 3.5 cm in diameter or smaller (mean 1.7 cm [SD 1.3]) were enrolled in a prospective, intention-to-treat, single-arm, multicentre clinical trial from seven centres in Europe, the USA, and Australia. Proof of malignancy was obtained by biopsy in all patients. Diagnoses included non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in 33 patients, metastasis from colorectal carcinoma in 53 patients, and metastasis from other primary malignancies in 20 patients. All patients were considered by the treating physician to be unsuitable for surgery and unfit for radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Patients underwent radiofrequency ablation in accordance with standard rules for CT-guided lung biopsy and were then followed for up to 2 years. Primary endpoints were technical success (defined as correct placement of the ablation device into all tumour targets with completion of the planned ablation protocol), safety (including identification of treatment-related complications and changes in pulmonary function), and confirmed complete response of tumours (according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors). Secondary endpoints were overall survival, cancer-specific survival, and quality of life. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00690703. Correct placement of the ablation device into the target tumour with completion of the planned treatment protocol was feasible in 105 (99%) of 106 patients. The technical failure in one patient was caused by the inability to place the device inside a small tumour. No procedure-related deaths occurred in any of the 137 ablation procedures. Major complications consisted of pneumothorax (n=27) or pleural effusion (n=4), which needed drainage. No significant worsening of pulmonary function was noted. A confirmed complete response of target tumours lasting at least 1 year was shown in 75 (88%) of 85 assessable patients. No differences in response were noted between patients with NSCLC or lung metastases. Overall survival was 70% (95% CI 51-83%) at 1 year and 48% (30-65%) at 2 years in patients with NSCLC, 89% (76-95%) at 1 year and 66% (53-79%) at 2 years in patients with colorectal metastases, and 92% (65-99%) at 1 year and 64% (43-82%) at 2 years in patients with other metastases. Cancer-specific survival was 92% (78-98%) at 1 year and 73% (54-86%) at 2 years in patients with NSCLC, 91% (78-96%) at 1 year and 68% (54-80%) at 2 years in patients with colorectal metastases, and 93% (67-99%) at 1 year and 67% (48-84%) at 2 years in patients with other metastases. Patients with stage I NSCLC (n=13) had a 2-year overall survival of 75% (45-92%) and a 2-year cancer-specific survival of 92% (66-99%).

Following a 2-week placebo lead-in, 39 outpatients with chronic PTSD and a Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) score \u226550 were randomized to a fixed dose of GR205171 (N=20) or placebo (N=19) for 8weeks. The primary endpoint was mean change from baseline to endpoint in the total CAPS score. Response rate (\u226550% reduction in baseline CAPS) and safety/tolerability were secondary endpoints. CSF SP concentrations were measured in a subgroup of patients prior to randomization. There was significant improvement in the mean CAPS total score across all patients over time, but no significant difference was found between GR205171 and placebo. Likewise, there was no significant effect of drug on the proportion of responders [40% GR205171 versus 21% placebo (p=0.30)]. An exploratory analysis showed that GR205171 treatment was associated with significant improvement compared to placebo on the CAPS hyperarousal symptom cluster. GR205171 was well-tolerated, with no discontinuations due to adverse events. CSF SP concentrations were positively correlated with baseline CAPS severity. The selective NK(1)R antagonist GR205171 had fewer adverse effects but was not significantly superior to placebo in the short-term treatment of chronic PTSD.

In this open-label phase III study, we randomized full-term 2-month-old infants to 4 doses of MenACWY-CRM coadministered with routine vaccines at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age or with routine vaccines alone. We monitored for local and systemic reactions and serious adverse events among all study participants and evaluated for sufficiency of the immune responses to MenACWY-CRM through serum bactericidal activity assay with human complement. Bactericidal antibodies were present in 94% to 100% of subjects against each of the serogroups in MenACWY-CRM after the 4-dose series and were 67% to 97% after the first 3 doses. Geometric mean titers were higher after the fourth dose of MenACWY-CRM compared with a single dose of MenACWY-CRM at 12 months of age for all serogroups (range of ratios, 4.5-38). Responses to 3 doses of routine vaccines coadministered with MenACWY-CRM were noninferior to routine vaccinations alone, except for small differences in pneumococcal serotype 6B responses after dose 3 but not dose 4 and pertactin after dose 3. Inclusion of MenACWY-CRM did not affect the safety or reactogenicity profiles of the routine infant vaccine series.

Pardoprunox tolerability was dose related: flexible-dose 12-42 mg/day showed the highest dropout rate due to treatment-emergent adverse events (Rembrandt, 56.0%; Vermeer, 46.3%) and overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (Rembrandt, 97.4%; Vermeer, 92.6%), primarily due to nausea, somnolence, and dizziness. Because pardoprunox showed similar efficacy across all dose groups, these observations suggest that the 12-42 mg/day dose range was higher than therapeutically required. Furthermore, the early onset of treatment-emergent adverse events and dropouts observed for pardoprunox suggest that titration was too rapid.

Perineural catheter insertion using ultrasound guidance alone is a relatively new approach. Previous studies have shown that ultrasound-guided catheters take less time to place with high placement success rates, but the analgesic efficacy compared with the established stimulating catheter technique remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that popliteal-sciatic perineural catheter insertion relying exclusively on ultrasound guidance results in superior postoperative analgesia compared with stimulating catheters. Preoperatively, subjects receiving a popliteal-sciatic perineural catheter for foot or ankle surgery were assigned randomly to either ultrasound guidance (bolus via needle with non-stimulating catheter insertion) or electrical stimulation (bolus via catheter). We used 1.5% mepivacaine 40 mL for the primary surgical nerve block and 0.2% ropivacaine (basal 8 mL\u00b7hr(-1); bolus 4 mL; 30 min lockout) was infused postoperatively. The primary outcome was average surgical pain on postoperative day one. Forty of the 80 subjects enrolled were randomized to each treatment group. One of 40 subjects (2.5%) in the ultrasound group failed catheter placement per protocol vs nine of 40 (22.5%) in the stimulating catheter group (P = 0.014). The difference in procedural duration (mean [95% confidence interval (CI)]) was -6.48 (-9.90 - -3.05) min, with ultrasound requiring 7.0 (4.0-14.1) min vs stimulation requiring 11.0 (5.0-30.0) min (P < 0.001).

The summary of product characteristics of the grass allergy immunotherapy tablet (AIT) (Phleum pratense grass pollen allergen extract) states that clinical effect may be observed in the first pollen season of treatment, if treatment is initiated \u22652 months (8 weeks) before the start of the grass pollen season. However, because patients with grass allergy may first present to physicians during the season, immediate treatment initiation (ie, in-season initiation) may increase treatment compliance and reduce the risk for disease progression compared with asking patients to return before the next pollen season to initiate treatment. This \"in-season approach\" may offer more patients the potentially beneficial treatment option of specific immunotherapy. However, to date, the immunomodulatory effects and tolerability of in-season treatment initiation is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the immunologic effects and tolerability of in-season initiation of treatment with the grass AIT. This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was carried out in Germany and Austria. Adults with grass pollen allergy (positive skin-prick test and specific grass-pollen immunoglobulin [Ig] E) and grass pollen-induced moderate to severe persistent rhinoconjunctivitis were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to receive once-daily grass AIT or placebo, starting during the 2008 grass pollen season and continuing for 8 to 10 weeks. The primary end point was change from baseline in IgE-blocking factor (serum components competing with IgE for allergen binding). Secondary end points included changes from baseline in specific IgE and IgG(4) and measures of tolerability (assessed mainly by adverse events [AEs]). Blood samples for immunologic assessment were obtained by the investigators at baseline and after treatment. All AEs observed by the investigator and/or reported by the patient were recorded throughout the trial and follow-up. A total of 276 patients were enrolled and formed the full analysis set (mean age, 35 years; 55% men, 45% women; 99% white; mean weight, 76 kg; history of asthma, 41%; mean duration of grass allergy, 15.1 years). No major differences in medical history were found between the grass AIT group (n = 219) and the placebo group (n = 57). The change from baseline in mean concentration of IgE-blocking factor was significantly greater with grass AIT compared with placebo (+0.14 vs +0.05; P < 0.0001). The changes from baseline in specific IgE and specific IgG(4) concentrations were significantly greater with AIT compared with placebo (IgE, +0.59 vs +0.21 log kU/L; IgG(4), +0.18 vs +0.04 log relative units; both, P < 0.0001). At least 1 AE was reported in 58% of patients in the AIT group and in 40% of patients in the placebo group. Most AEs considered related to AIT were mild or moderate events in the mouth, throat, and/or ears (eg, oral pruritus). Four serious AEs were reported in the AIT group (sinusitis, road traffic accident, salmonellosis, meniscus lesion), but all were considered unlikely to be related to treatment. Three percent of the grass AIT group and 2% of the placebo group were withdrawn from the trial due to an AE. In-season initiation of grass AIT was associated with an immunomodulatory response in terms of induction of IgE-blocking factor, specific IgE, and specific IgG(4). In-season initiation of grass AIT was generally well tolerated in this group of adults with moderate to severe grass pollen-induced rhinoconjunctivitis. These findings are consistent with those related to the preseasonal initiation of AIT therapy.

Efficacy and safety data were pooled from 12 studies (n=6151). These were 6- to 96-week randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo- or active-controlled trials with lapaquistat monotherapy or coadministration with other lipid-altering drugs in dyslipidemic patients, including a large (n=2121) 96-week safety study. All studies included lapaquistat 100 mg daily; 5 included 50 mg; and 1 included 25 mg. The main outcome measures were the percent change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, secondary lipid/metabolic parameters, and overall safety. Lapaquistat 100 mg significantly decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 21.6% in monotherapy and by 18.0% in combination with a statin. It also reduced other cardiovascular risk markers, such as C-reactive protein. Total adverse events were higher for lapaquistat than placebo, although individual events were generally similar. At 100 mg, there was an increase in alanine aminotransferase value \u22653 times the upper limit of normal on \u22652 consecutive visits (2.0% versus 0.3% for placebo in the pooled efficacy studies; 2.7% versus 0.7% for low-dose atorvastatin in the long-term study). Two patients receiving lapaquistat 100 mg met the Hy Law criteria of alanine aminotransferase elevation plus increased total bilirubin. Squalene synthase inhibition with lapaquistat acetate, alone or in combination with statins, effectively lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner. Elevations in alanine aminotransferase, combined with a rare increase in bilirubin, presented potential hepatic safety issues, resulting in termination of development.

Current hypertension guidelines recommend using two antihypertensive agents when blood pressure (BP) control is not achieved with one single agent. This study was designed to assess the antihypertensive benefit of the olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg combination versus olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg monotherapy in patients with moderate to severe hypertension. This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, up-titration, multicentre, multinational, phase III study. Following a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in phase, 846 hypertensive patients with mean seated systolic BP (SeSBP) of 160-200 mmHg and mean seated diastolic BP (SeDBP) of 100-120 mmHg were randomized (1 : 2 ratio) to receive double-blind treatment with olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg or olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg for 8 weeks (phase A). At week 8, patients not reaching BP goal (<140/90 mmHg; <130/80 mmHg in patients with diabetes mellitus) were up-titrated from olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg to olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg or from olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg to olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 25 mg for an additional 8 weeks (phase B). Patients on goal continued their initial treatment. The primary efficacy parameter was the change in mean SeDBP during phase A. Olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg reduced mean SeDBP significantly more (-18.9 mmHg) than olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg (-15.8 mmHg) after 8 weeks of double-blind treatment (difference: -3.1 mmHg, p < 0.0001). Olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg also reduced mean SeSBP significantly more than olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg (-5.4 mmHg, p < 0.0001). As a result, BP goal rates at week 8 were significantly higher with olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg than with olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg (58.5% vs 44.3%; odds ratio 1.88; 95% CI 1.32, 2.54). During phase B, mean BP reductions were greater in patients up-titrated from olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg to olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg than in those continuing on olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg (SeDBP: -9.3 mmHg vs -0.5 mmHg; SeSBP: -12.4 mmHg vs -0.5 mmHg). Similarly, mean BP reductions were greater in patients up-titrated from olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg to olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 25 mg than in those continuing on olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg (SeDBP: -8.0 mmHg vs -0.3 mmHg; SeSBP: -12.1 mmHg vs -0.4 mmHg). In patients not on goal at week 8, addition of HCTZ 12.5 mg to olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg or up-titration from olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg to olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 25 mg brought additional patients to goal at week 16 (38.8% vs 36.9%). All treatments were well tolerated. The olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg combination is superior to olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg monotherapy in reducing SeDBP and SeSBP and increasing BP goal rates after 8 weeks. Patients not on goal at week 8 with olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg or olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg benefited from adding HCTZ 12.5 mg or up-titrating to olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg/HCTZ 25 mg, respectively, confirming that up-titration is a clinically meaningful way to improve BP control.

A total of 65 patients underwent lower-limb amputation and were assigned to five analgesic regimens: (1) Epi/Epi/Epi patients received perioperative epidural analgesia and epidural anesthesia; (2) PCA/Epi/Epi patients received preoperative intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), postoperative epidural analgesia, and epidural anesthesia; (3) PCA/Epi/PCA patients received perioperative intravenous PCA and epidural anesthesia; (4) PCA/GA/PCA patients received perioperative intravenous PCA and general anesthesia (GA); (5) controls received conventional analgesia and GA. Epidural analgesia or intravenous PCA started 48 h preoperatively and continued 48 h postoperatively. The results of the visual analog scale and the McGill Pain Questionnaire were recorded perioperatively and at 1 and 6 months.

The primary endpoint was a composite of diarrhea, dysentery, and lower respiratory tract infection episodes (DDL) recorded through home visits every 2 d during the intervention and then weekly for 4 mo. The noninferiority margin was 1.2. Secondary endpoints included hemoglobin and anthropometric changes at 2 and 6 mo. All deaths and hospitalizations were documented. To capture seasonal variation, the study was repeated in the winter and summer with 2 distinct groups. An intention-to-treat analysis of recurrent events was performed by using the univariate Anderson-Gill model. The baseline characteristics of the subjects were similar. Analysis of phase-aggregated DDL data showed that iron MNP was not inferior to PP (relative risk: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.62, 1.04) and improved hemoglobin concentrations (P < 0.0001). We recorded no deaths, and hospitalizations were rare. Iron MNP is safe and efficacious when provided to children aged 12-24 mo with moderate-to-severe malnutrition and anemia. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00530374.

Validated biomarkers predictive of response/resistance to anthracyclines in breast cancer are currently lacking. The neoadjuvant Trial of Principle (TOP) study, in which patients with estrogen receptor (ER) -negative tumors were treated with anthracycline (epirubicin) monotherapy, was specifically designed to evaluate the predictive value of topoisomerase II-\u03b1 (TOP2A) and develop a gene expression signature to identify those patients who do not benefit from anthracyclines. The TOP trial included 149 patients, 139 of whom were evaluable for response prediction analyses. The primary end point was pathologic complete response (pCR). TOP2A and gene expression profiles were evaluated using pre-epirubicin biopsies. Gene expression data from ER-negative samples of the EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) 10994/BIG (Breast International Group) 00-01 and MDACC (MD Anderson Cancer Center) 2003-0321 neoadjuvant trials were used for validation purposes. A pCR was obtained in 14% of the evaluable patients in the TOP trial. TOP2A amplification, but not protein overexpression, was significantly associated with pCR (P \u2264 .001 v P \u2264 .33). We developed an anthracycline-based score (A-Score) combining three signatures: a TOP2A gene signature and two previously published signatures related to tumor invasion and immune response. The A-Score was characterized by a high negative predictive value ([NPV]; NPV, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.00) overall and in the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -negative and HER2-positive subpopulations. Its performance was independently confirmed in the anthracycline-based arms of the two validation trials (BIG 00-01: NPV, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.94 and MDACC 2003-0321: NPV, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.00). Given its high NPV, the A-Score could become, if further validated, a useful clinical tool to identify those patients who do not benefit from anthracyclines and could therefore be spared the non-negligible adverse effects.

The percentage of patients (adjusted for baseline differences) achieving LDL-C < 2 mmol/l was 69.4% with ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/40 mg, compared with 33.5% for atorvastatin 40 mg [odds ratio 4.5 (95% CI: 3.0-6.8); p < 0.001] and 14.3% for rosuvastatin 5 or 10 mg [odds ratio 13.6 (95% CI: 8.6-21.6); p < 0.001]. Similar results were observed for achievement of total cholesterol < 4.0 mmol/l. All study treatments were well tolerated. Approximately 45% of patients screened had not achieved LDL-C < 2 mmol/l after > or = 12 weeks of treatment with simvastatin 40 mg. In this group, treatment with ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/40 mg achieved target LDL-C levels in a significantly higher proportion of patients during a 6-week period than switching to either atorvastatin 40 mg or rosuvastatin 5-10 mg.

Three validated assays (two screening immunoassays and a neutralizing antibody bioassay) were used to detect the presence of anti-panitumumab antibodies in serum samples collected from patients enrolled in four panitumumab combination chemotherapy clinical trials. The impact of anti-panitumumab antibodies on pharmacokinetic and safety profiles was analyzed using population pharmacokinetic analysis and descriptive statistics, respectively. Of 1124 patients treated with panitumumab in combination with oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based chemotherapy with postbaseline samples available for testing, 20 (1.8%) patients developed binding antibodies and 2 (0.2%) developed neutralizing antibodies. The incidence of anti-panitumumab antibodies was similar in patients with tumors expressing wild-type or mutant KRAS and in patients receiving oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based chemotherapies. No evidence of an altered pharmacokinetic or safety profile was found in patients who tested positive for anti-panitumumab antibodies. The immunogenicity of panitumumab in the combination chemotherapy setting was infrequent and similar to the immunogenicity observed in the monotherapy setting. Panitumumab immunogenicity did not appear to alter pharmacokinetic or safety profiles. This low rate of immunogenicity may be attributed to the fully human nature of panitumumab.

We, therefore, studied the effects of selective endothelin-A receptor antagonism in proteinuric chronic kidney disease patients, assessing proteinuria, blood pressure (BP), and arterial stiffness, key independent, surrogate markers of chronic kidney disease progression and cardiovascular disease risk. In a randomized, double-blind, 3-way crossover study, 27 subjects on recommended renoprotective treatment received 6 weeks of placebo, 100 mg once daily of sitaxsentan, and 30 mg once daily of nifedipine long acting. Twenty-four-hour proteinuria, protein:creatinine ratio, 24-hour ambulatory BP, and pulse wave velocity (as a measure of arterial stiffness) were measured at baseline and week 6 of each treatment. In 13 subjects, renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate were assessed at baseline and week 6 of each period. Compared with placebo, sitaxsentan reduced 24-hour proteinuria (-0.56\u00b10.20 g/d; P=0.0069), protein:creatinine ratio (-38\u00b115 mg/mmol; P=0.0102), BP (-3.4\u00b11.2 mm Hg; P=0.0069), and pulse wave velocity (-0.64\u00b10.24 m/s; P=0.0052).

As some patients do not attend organized rehabilitation programs, home-based exercise should be an alternative. We investigated whether AIT could be performed effectively at home, and compared the effects on peak oxygen uptake with that observed after a standard care, four-week residential rehabilitation.

Patients were randomized within 3 h of onset to receive either intravenous alteplase, in accordance with the current European labeling, or up to 0.9 mg/kg intra-arterial alteplase (maximum 90 mg), over 60 min into the thrombus, if necessary with mechanical clot disruption and/or retrieval. The purpose of the study was to determine the proportion of favorable outcome at 90 days. Safety endpoints included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH), death and other serious adverse events. RESULTS 54 patients (25 IAT) were enrolled. Median time from stroke onset to start to treatment was 3 h 15 min for IAT and 2 h 35 min for IVT (p<0.001). Almost twice as many patients on IAT as those on IVT survived without residual disability (12/25 vs 8/29; OR 3.2; 95% CI 0.9 to 11.4; p=0.067). SICH occurred in 2/25 patients on IAT and in 4/29 on IVT (OR 0.5; CI 0.1 to 3.3; p=0.675). Mortality at day 7 was 5/25 (IAT) compared with 4/29 (IVT) (OR 1.6; CI 0.4 to 6.7; p=0.718).

In the protocol using continuous glucose monitoring, glycemic variability (as measured by MAGE) was lower with continuous administration of the diabetes-specific than the standard formula (64.6 +/- 6.8 mg/dL vs. 110.6 +/-15.3 mg/dL, P = 0.003). Also, administration of the diabetes-specific formula resulted in lower mean glucose concentrations during feeding (171.1 +/- 16.1 vs. 202.1 +/- 17.4 mg/dL, P = 0.024) and insulin requirements (7.8 +/- 2.3 vs. 10.9 +/- 3.3 units/day, P = 0.039) than the standard formula. Relative to the standard formula, the diabetes-specific formula reduced postprandial glycemia, mean glucose, glycemic variability, and short-acting insulin requirements. These results suggest potential clinical usefulness of a diabetes-specific enteral formula for minimizing glycemic excursions in hospitalized patients.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, chronic illness associated with substantial disability and economic burden. Although a number of effective antidepressants are available, the need for new medications that are effective and well tolerated remains. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of fixed-dose desvenlafaxine 50 and 100 mg/d with placebo for MDD. A post hoc pooled analysis was conducted to evaluate this study in the context of all similarly designed, completed studies with the 2 doses. This was an 8-week, Phase III, randomized, double-blind, duloxetine-referenced, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial conducted in 21 centers across the United States. Duloxetine was included for assay sensitivity as a positive control; the study was not designed or powered to compare desvenlafaxine with duloxetine. Participants were outpatients aged > or =18 years with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition-defined MDD and a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D(17)) score > or =20. Patients were randomly assigned at baseline to fixed-dose desvenlafaxine (50 or 100 mg/d), fixed-dose duloxetine (60 mg/d), or placebo. The primary outcome measure was HAM-D(17) total score at the final evaluation. Additional measures included the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) score, Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score, Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) score, and 6-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Bech version (HAM-D(6)). Tolerability assessments included discontinuation rates, adverse events (AEs), vital signs, and laboratory tests. The post hoc pooled analysis was performed using data from the current study and 2 previously published, positive studies that compared the efficacy and tolerability of desvenlafaxine 50 and 100 mg/d with placebo for MDD. The design and methodologies of the 2 studies were similar to the methodology of the current trial, other than not including a reference compound. Of the 925 patients who were screened, 287 did not meet entry criteria, and 638 patients enrolled in the study; the intent-to-treat (ITT) population included 615 patients who were evaluated for efficacy (mean [SD] age range, 38.8-40.7 [12.1-13.2] years; mean weight range, 83.3-87.0 [22.8-23.9] kg; female sex, 398 [64.7%]; white race, 458 [74.5%]). The primary end point did not reach significance based on the global F test for controlling multiplicity of the desvenlafaxine doses. Based on pairwise comparison, significantly greater improvements on the HAM-D(17) were observed in the desven-lafaxine 100 mg/d (-10.5; P = 0.028, unadjusted for multiple comparisons) and duloxetine 60 mg/d groups (-10.3; P = 0.047) compared with placebo (-8.7). Desvenlafaxine 100 mg/d and duloxetine 60 mg/d were associated with significantly better scores compared with placebo on the CGI-I, MADRS, CGI-S, and HAM-D(6). No significant differences were observed in any scale between the desvenlafaxine 50 mg/d and placebo groups. Discontinuation rates due to AEs were 5%, 7%, 13%, and 6% for the desvenlafaxine 50-mg/d, desvenlafaxine 100-mg/d, duloxetine 60-mg/d, and placebo groups, respectively. The ITT population from all 3 studies in the pooled analysis consisted of 1388 patients (mean [SD] age range, 38.8-45.7 [12.1-12.6] years; mean weight range, 73.1-87.0 [17.6-23.9] kg; female sex, 896 [64.6%]; white race, 1136 [81.8%]). Significantly greater improvements on the HAM-D(17) were observed for desvenlafaxine 50 mg/d (-11.5; P < 0.001) and 100 mg/d (-11.8; P < 0.001) versus placebo (-9.6). Both doses were significantly better than placebo on the CGI-I, MADRS, and HAM-D(6). The current study failed to meet its primary efficacy end point based on the a priori analysis plan. Desvenlafaxine was generally well tolerated. A post hoc pooled analysis of this trial and 2 previously published trials with both desvenlafaxine 50 and 100 mg/d found both doses to be effective for MDD compared with placebo.

Patients from phase 1 RP (CNTF1); phase 2 GA (CNTF2); and phase 2 late and early stage RP (CNTF3, and CNTF4) studies received an ECT-CNTF implant, designated as \"NT-501,\" in one eye. Per protocol, all implants (n = 10) were removed at 6 months from the CNTF1 study patients. Explant for the phase 2 studies was optional, but several patients were explanted at 12, 18, and 24 months post implant. A small amount of vitreous sample was collected at the time of explant. The rate of CNTF secretion from the explants and the corresponding vitreous CNTF levels were evaluated for each time point. Serum samples from these patients were evaluated for CNTF, anti-CNTF antibodies, and antibodies to the encapsulated cells. NT-501 implants produced CNTF consistently over a 2-year period.

Overall, 503 patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention at 43 centers in the United States and Canada were randomized in an open-label fashion to 1 of 4 arms: UFH 70 U/kg, M118 50 IU/kg IV, M118 75 IU/kg IV, or M118 100 IU/kg IV. The primary outcome was the composite of death, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, stroke, thrombocytopenia, catheter thrombus, bailout use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, or any bleeding through 30 days.

The primary analysis comparing the rates of the primary end points between the pooled M118 groups versus UFH demonstrated that M118 was noninferior to UFH at preventing percutaneous coronary intervention-related complications (28.4% pooled M118 arms versus 31.1% UFH). The adverse event profiles of M118 and UFH were comparable.

Endothelial function was assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in 8 healthy men before and after an HFM preceded (16 to 18 h) by rest, a single bout of continuous moderate-intensity exercise (CME), and high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE). Before the HFM, initial brachial artery diameters were similar in all trials (0.43 +/- 0.04 cm), but after the HFM, basal diameter decreased only in the control (0.39 +/- 0.03 cm) and CME (0.38 +/- 0.04 cm) trials. Before the HFM, FMD/shear was improved by a single bout of CME (+20%, p < 0.01) and HIIE (+45%, p < 0.01; group differences, p < 0.01), with no effect in the control trial. After the HFM (30, 120, and 240 min), FMD decayed to a lesser extent with CME, but in a similar fashion to the control trial.

Dipyridamole inhibits the transport of extracellular adenosine into the cytosol resulting in increased extracellular adenosine and subsequent vasodilation. In addition, we studied the effect of statin therapy in a forearm model of ischemia-reperfusion injury. Volunteers randomly received rosuvastatin or placebo in a double-blind parallel design (n=21). The forearm vasodilator response to intraarterial dipyridamole was determined in the absence and presence of the adenosine antagonist caffeine.

In addition, healthy men were randomly divided in 3 groups to receive either placebo (n=10), rosuvastatin (n=22), or rosuvastatin combined with intravenous caffeine (n=12). Subsequently, volunteers performed forearm ischemic exercise. At reperfusion, Tc-99m-labeled annexin A5 was infused intravenously and scintigraphic images were acquired, providing an early marker of cell injury. Rosuvastatin treatment significantly increased the vasodilator response to dipyridamole, which was prevented by caffeine. Rosuvastatin did not influence the response to either sodium nitroprusside or adenosine indicating a specific interaction between rosuvastatin and dipyridamole, which does not result from an effect of rosuvastatin on adenosine clearance nor adenosine-receptor affinity or efficacy.

The cessation rate at 12 weeks after the baseline visit, assessed as the bioverified point prevalence of abstinence, was 71.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 58.8%-83.5%) in the ATP group and 53.6% (41.8%-65.4%) in the ITT group. Participants rated the liquid nicotine delivery system highly and also expressed general satisfaction. Few adverse events were identified with no serious adverse events. These results support the efficacy of the liquid nicotine delivery system in smoking cessation. If this nicotine delivery product proves to be effective in larger trials, it could represent an inexpensive, readily accessible and well-tolerated agent to promote smoking cessation.

Effects of MF/F on asthma control and symptoms were evaluated and adverse events recorded. Seven hundred twenty-eight patients were randomized. Significant improvement from baseline to week 12 occurred for mean change in FEV(1) AUC(0-12h) with MF/F 400/10 microg (4.19 L x hour) versus MF 400 microg (2.04 L x hour; p < 0.001). Both MF/F doses resulted in rapid (5 minutes) and sustained improvement in lung function throughout 12 weeks. Both MF/F doses were superior to MF in improving asthma control and reducing nocturnal awakenings due to asthma requiring short-acting beta(2)-agonist use. All treatments were well tolerated.

Children who required the administration of i.v. maintenance fluid for at least 24 h following hospitalization were eligible for inclusion. The children were randomized to three i.v. fluid groups: Group A, 0.9% saline in 5% dextrose at the standard maintenance rate; Group B, 0.18% saline in 5% dextrose at the standard maintenance rate; Group C, 0.18% saline in 5% dextrose at two-thirds of the standard maintenance rate. The primary outcome measure was incidence of hyponatraemia (plasma sodium < 130 mEq/L). Of the 167 patients enrolled, 58, 56 and 53 patients were randomized to Group A, B and C, respectively. We observed that 14.3% (8/56) of the children administered 0.18% saline in 5% dextrose at the standard maintenance rate (Group B) developed hyponatraemia compared with 1.72% of the children in Group A and 3.8% of those in Group C.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in sputum PA density. Secondary endpoints included changes in pulmonary function, the need for other anti-PA antimicrobials, changes in patient-reported symptom scores, and safety monitoring. All doses of MP-376 resulted in reduced sputum PA density at Day 28, with MP-376 240 mg twice a day showing a 0.96 log difference compared with placebo (P = 0.001).

Infliximab improved the inflammatory status as indicated by reduced high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and fibrinogen levels (2.77 \u00b1 0.6 to 1.8 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcg/L, and 3.42 \u00b1 0.18 to 3.18 \u00b1 0.28 g/L; (day 0 and day 70, P = 0.020 and 0.037 respectively), but did not improve insulin resistance (HOMA index and intravenous glucose-tolerance test [ivGGT]) or endothelial function.

In type 2 diabetic patients, insulin detemir (B29Lys(\u03b5-tetradecanoyl),desB30 human insulin) induces less weight gain than NPH insulin. Due to the proposed reduction of tubular action by insulin detemir, type 2 diabetic patients should have increased urinary sodium excretion, thereby reducing extracellular volume and body weight when changed from NPH insulin to insulin detemir. In a randomised, open-labelled, two-way crossover study of 24 patients with type 2 diabetes, patients were first treated with NPH insulin or insulin detemir for 8 weeks. Thereafter, they were changed to the other insulin for 8 weeks. In a third 1 week period, they were changed back to the first insulin.

To determine whether IL-17A mediates human inflammatory diseases, we investigated the efficacy and safety of AIN457, a human antibody to IL-17A, in patients with psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic noninfectious uveitis. Patients with chronic plaque-type psoriasis (n = 36), rheumatoid arthritis (n = 52), or chronic noninfectious uveitis (n = 16) were enrolled in clinical trials to evaluate the effects of neutralizing IL-17A by AIN457 at doses of 3 to 10 mg/kg, given intravenously. We evaluated efficacy by measuring the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI), the American College of Rheumatology 20% response (ACR20) for rheumatoid arthritis, or the number of responders for uveitis, as defined by either vision improvement or reduction in ocular inflammation or corticosteroid dose. AIN457 treatment induced clinically relevant responses of variable magnitude in patients suffering from each of these diverse immune-mediated diseases. Variable response rates may be due to heterogeneity in small patient populations, differential pathogenic roles of IL-17A in these diseases, and the different involvement or activation of IL-17A-producing cells.

Sixteen patients (30%) failed to complete adjuvant therapy, due to disease progression (7 patients), toxicity (7 patients), and consent withdrawal (2 patients). No patients completed planned therapy without dose modification. Median overall survival was 25 months (confidence interval [CI] = 21.5-48.5 months). Actuarial overall survival for the 1-, 2- and 3-year periods were 75% (CI = 61-85%), 56% (CI = 41-69%), and 41% (26-55%), respectively. This phase II trial demonstrated increased patient survival compared with historical controls, and equivalent survival compared with the regimen combining interferon-alpha with 5-fluorouracil-based chemoradiation. Despite these encouraging results, significant concerns regarding dose- and treatment-limiting toxicities remain.

A single administration of laninamivir octanoate, a long-acting neuraminidase inhibitor, against influenza infection has been proven effective in nonclinical studies. This study evaluated the clinical efficacy of laninamivir octanoate for the treatment of adult influenza patients. A double-blind, randomized controlled trial examined whether laninamivir octanoate was noninferior to oseltamivir. A total of 1003 patients aged \u2265 20 years with febrile influenza symptoms for no more than 36 h were randomized to receive either 40 mg of laninamivir octanoate, 20 mg of laninamivir octanoate, or oseltamivir. Laninamivir octanoate was inhaled once on day 1, and oseltamivir (75 mg) was administered orally twice daily for 5 days. The primary end point was the time to illness alleviation. A total of 996 patients were included in the primary analysis (40-mg laninamivir octanoate, n = 334; 20-mg laninamivir octanoate, n = 326; and oseltamivir, n = 336). The median time to illness alleviation in the 40-mg laninamivir octanoate, 20-mg laninamivir octanoate, and oseltamivir groups was 73.0, 85.8, and 73.6 h, respectively.

Approximately 75% of postmenopausal women experience vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes). Currently, hormone replacement therapy is the only approved treatment for hot flashes. However, its use has been associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke and venous thromboembolic disease. Gabapentin has also been demonstrated to be efficacious in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women when administered three times a day. A gastroretentive extended-release formulation of gabapentin (gabapentin-ER) has recently been demonstrated to be efficacious in the treatment of postmenopausal hot flashes. The objective of this paper is to report the steady-state pharmacokinetics and safety of gabapentin with different dosing regimens of gabapentin-ER in postmenopausal women with hot flashes. This was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, dose-escalating, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in 124 postmenopausal women experiencing \u22657 moderate to severe hot flashes per day. The study consisted of two 5-week treatment periods, with each one preceded by a 1-week titration to the assigned dose. Groups A, B and C received gabapentin-ER 600 mg evening (pm), 600 mg morning (am)/600 mg pm and 1200 mg pm in the first period, and then 600 mg am/1200 mg pm, 600 mg am/1800 mg pm and 1200 mg am/1800 mg pm in the second period, respectively. The tablets were taken after a non-specified meal. Pharmacokinetic sampling was conducted over a 24-hour period at the end of each study period. Plasma samples were analysed by a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on the concentration-time data to determine area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to 24 hours (AUC(24)). Maximum (C(max)), minimum (C(min)) and average (C(avg)) drug concentration and time to reach C(max) (t(max)) were determined by inspection of the data. Tolerability was evaluated by physical examination, clinical laboratory measurements and adverse events monitoring. Gabapentin exposure at steady state, as measured by AUC(24), increased with doses from 600 mg/day to 3000 mg/day, although there was a slight decrease in gabapentin's relative bioavailability with increasing dose compared with the 600 mg dose. The relative bioavailability compared with the 600 mg dose was 86-88% for the 1200 mg/day doses, 75% for the 1800 mg/day dose, 84% for the 2400 mg/day dose, and 73% for the 3000 mg/day dose. C(max) generally increased with increasing dose as did C(min) and C(avg) for the various treatments in a manner that was consistent with the dosing regimen. The values of t(max) were not different between the various doses, with the median t(max) values relative to the most recent dose ranging from 6 to 8 hours for all dose levels. Gabapentin-ER was generally well tolerated at all doses studied. The most common AEs were headache, dizziness and somnolence, with most being mild in intensity. Seven patients withdrew from the study due to AEs. The pharmacokinetic profile of gabapentin-ER may allow for once- or twice-daily dosing while maintaining bioavailability and thus efficacy. Gabapentin-ER was well tolerated. Registered as ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00511953.

We randomized 102 patients undergoing TKA to receive either epidural analgesia (EDA group) or LIA (ropivacaine 150 mg and epinephrine 0.5 mg) combined with ketorolac 30 mg and morphine 5 mg given either locally (LIA group) or i.v.

After a 4-week, single-masked run-in period, patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or salsalate in dosages of 3.0, 3.5, or 4.0 g/d for 14 weeks (27 patients each) in addition to their current therapy. Change in HbA1c was the primary outcome. Adverse effects and changes in measures of coronary risk and renal function were secondary outcomes. Higher proportions of patients in the 3 salsalate treatment groups experienced decreases in HbA1c levels of 0.5% or more from baseline (P = 0.009). Mean HbA1c changes were -0.36% (P = 0.02) at 3.0 g/d, -0.34% (P = 0.02) at 3.5 g/d, and -0.49% (P = 0.001) at 4.0 g/d compared with placebo. Other markers of glycemic control also improved in the 3 salsalate groups, as did circulating triglyceride and adiponectin concentrations. Mild hypoglycemia was more common with salsalate; documented events occurred only in patients taking sulfonylureas. Urine albumin concentrations increased in all salsalate groups compared with placebo. The drug was otherwise well tolerated. The number of patients studied and the trial duration were insufficient to warrant recommending the use of salsalate for type 2 diabetes at this time. Salsalate lowers HbA1c levels and improves other markers of glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and may therefore provide a new avenue for treatment.

The coprimary immunogenicity end points were the proportion of subjects with antibody titers of 1:40 or more on hemagglutination-inhibition assay, the proportion of subjects with either seroconversion or a significant increase in antibody titer, and the factor increase in the geometric mean titer. By day 21 after the first dose, antibody titers of 1:40 or more were observed in 114 of 120 subjects (95.0%) who received the 15-microg dose and in 106 of 119 subjects (89.1%) who received the 30-microg dose. A similar result was observed after the second dose of vaccine. No deaths, serious adverse events, or adverse events of special interest were reported. Local discomfort (e.g., injection-site tenderness or pain) was reported by 56.3% of subjects, and systemic symptoms (e.g., headache) by 53.8% of subjects after each dose. Nearly all events were mild to moderate in intensity. A single 15-microg dose of 2009 H1N1 vaccine was immunogenic in adults, with mild-to-moderate vaccine-associated reactions.

A total of 2,055 patients were randomised to 28-35 days treatment with oral dabigatran, 220 mg once-daily, starting with a half-dose 1-4 hours after surgery, or subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg once-daily, starting the evening before surgery. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of total venous thromboembolism [VTE] (venographic or symptomatic) and death from all-causes. The main secondary composite outcome was major VTE (proximal deep-vein thrombosis or non-fatal pulmonary embolism) plus VTE-related death. The main safety outcome was major bleeding. In total, 2,013 were treated, of whom 1,577 operated patients were included in the primary efficacy analysis. The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 7.7% of the dabigatran group versus 8.8% of the enoxaparin group, risk difference (RD) -1.1% (95%CI -3.8 to 1.6%); p<0.0001 for the pre-specified non-inferiority margin.

Yet to date there have been no pharmacogenetic studies of BDNF in ADHD. A total of 102 drug-naive ADHD children (8.7\u00b12.1 yr) were treated with osmotic release oral system-methylphenidate (OROS-MPH) for 12 wk, and four kinds of response criteria were applied, based first, on a combined threshold of the ADHD Rating Scale - IV (ARS) and the Clinical Global Impression - Improvement scale (CGI-I); second, on scores of 1 or 2 vs. 3-7 on the CGI - Severity scale; third, on a >50% reduction in ARS scores; and fourth, on satisfaction of all of the aforementioned criteria. The Val\u2076\u2076Met polymorphism of BDNF and six single nucleotide polymorphisms from the SLC6A2, ADRA2A and NTF-3 genes were tested for association with each criterion.

Few studies have investigated the injection patterns for botulinum toxin type A for the treatment of heterogeneous forms of cervical dystonia (CD). This large, prospective, open-label, multicentre study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of 500 U botulinum toxin A for the initial treatment according to a standardised algorithm of the two most frequent forms of CD, predominantly torticollis and laterocollis. Patients (aged \u2265 18 years) with CD not previously treated with botulinum neurotoxin therapy were given one treatment with 500 U Dysport, according to a defined intramuscular injection algorithm based on clinical assessment of direction of head deviation, occurrence of shoulder elevation, occurrence of tremor (all evaluated using the Tsui rating scale) and hypertrophy of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. In this study, 516 patients were enrolled, the majority of whom (95.0%) completed treatment. Most patients had torticollis (78.1%). At week 4, mean Tsui scores had significantly decreased by -4.01, -3.76 and -4.09 points in the total, torticollis and laterocollis populations, respectively. Symptom improvement was equally effective between groups. Tsui scores remained significantly below baseline at week 12 in both groups. Treatment was well tolerated; the most frequent adverse events were muscular weakness (13.8%), dysphagia (9.9%) and neck pain (6.6%). Dysport 500 U is effective and well tolerated for the de novo management of a range of heterogeneous forms of CD, when using a standardised regimen that allows tailored dosing based on individual symptom assessment.

We measured insulin secretion and action as well as glucose effectiveness in 14 subjects with type 2 diabetes who received vildagliptin (50 mg b.i.d.) or placebo for 10 days in random order separated by a 3-week washout.

Preliminary work suggests that single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (sTMS) could be effective as a treatment for migraine. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of a new portable sTMS device for acute treatment of migraine with aura. We undertook a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, two-phase, sham-controlled study at 18 centres in the USA. 267 adults aged 18-68 years were enrolled into phase one. All individuals had to meet international criteria for migraine with aura, with visual aura preceding at least 30% of migraines followed by moderate or severe headache in more than 90% of those attacks. 66 patients dropped out during phase one. In phase two, 201 individuals were randomly allocated by computer to either sham stimulation (n=99) or sTMS (n=102). We instructed participants to treat up to three attacks over 3 months while experiencing aura. The primary outcome was pain-free response 2 h after the first attack, and co-primary outcomes were non-inferiority at 2 h for nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. Analyses were modified intention to treat and per protocol. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00449540. 37 patients did not treat a migraine attack and were excluded from outcome analyses. 164 patients treated at least one attack with sTMS (n=82) or sham stimulation (n=82; modified intention-to-treat analysis set). Pain-free response rates after 2 h were significantly higher with sTMS (32/82 [39%]) than with sham stimulation (18/82 [22%]), for a therapeutic gain of 17% (95% CI 3-31%; p=0.0179). Sustained pain-free response rates significantly favoured sTMS at 24 h and 48 h post-treatment. Non-inferiority was shown for nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. No device-related serious adverse events were recorded, and incidence and severity of adverse events were similar between sTMS and sham groups. Early treatment of migraine with aura by sTMS resulted in increased freedom from pain at 2 h compared with sham stimulation, and absence of pain was sustained 24 h and 48 h after treatment. sTMS could be a promising acute treatment for some patients with migraine with aura.

The aim of this study was to determine the dose-response relationship and assess the efficacy and safety of amlodipine or losartan monotherapy and amlodipine camsylate/losartan combination therapy in patients with essential hypertension. This was an 8-week, randomized, double-blind, factorial design, phase II, multicenter study conducted in outpatient hospital clinics among adult patients aged 18-75 years with essential hypertension. At screening, patients received placebo for 2-4 weeks. Eligible patients (n=320) were randomized to one of eight treatment groups: amlodipine 5\u2009mg or 10\u2009mg, losartan 50\u2009mg or 100\u2009mg, amlodipine camsylate/losartan 5\u2009mg/50\u2009mg, 5\u2009mg/100\u2009mg, 10\u2009mg/50\u2009mg, or 10\u2009mg/100\u2009mg. The assumption of strict superiority was estimated using the mean change in sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at 8 weeks. Safety was monitored through physical examinations, vital signs, laboratory test results, ECG, and adverse events. The reduction in DBP at 8 weeks was significantly greater in patients treated with the combination therapies compared with the respective monotherapies for all specified comparisons except amlodipine camsylate/losartan 10\u2009mg/100\u2009mg versus amlodipine 10\u2009mg.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the dose and duration of drotrecogin alfa (activated) treatment using serial measurements of protein C compared to standard therapy in patients with severe sepsis. This was a phase 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled study. Adult patients with two or more sepsis-induced organ dysfunctions were enrolled. Protein C deficient patients were randomized to standard therapy (24 \u03bcg/kg/hr infusion for 96 hours) or alternative therapy (higher dose and/or variable duration; 24/30/36 \u03bcg/kg/hr for 48 to 168 hours). The primary outcome was a change in protein C level in the alternative therapy group, between study Day 1 and Day 7, compared to standard therapy. Of 557 patients enrolled, 433 patients received randomized therapy; 206 alternative, and 227 standard. Baseline characteristics of the groups were largely similar. The difference in absolute change in protein C from Day 1 to Day 7 between the two therapy groups was 7% (P = 0.011). Higher doses and longer infusions were associated with a more pronounced increase in protein C level, with no serious bleeding events. The same doses and longer infusions were associated with a larger increase in protein C level; higher rates of serious bleeding when groups received the same treatment; but no clear increased risk of bleeding during the longer infusion. This group also experienced a higher mortality rate; however, there was no clear link to infusion duration. The study met its primary objective of increased protein C levels in patients receiving alternative therapy demonstrating that variable doses and/or duration of drotrecogin alfa (activated) can improve protein C levels, and also provides valuable information for incorporation into potential future studies.

Recently, L-isoleucine and its analogues have been found to induce antimicrobial peptides. The objectives of the study were to examine if addition of L-isoleucine to oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution would reduce stool output and/or duration of acute diarrhoea in children and induce antimicrobial peptides in intestine. This double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Dhaka Hospital of ICDDR,B. Fifty male children, aged 6-36 months, with acute diarrhoea and some dehydration, attending the hospital, were included in the study. Twenty-five children received L-isoleucine (2 g/L)-added ORS (study), and 25 received ORS without L-isoleucine (control). Stool weight, ORS intake, and duration of diarrhoea were the primary outcomes. There was a trend in reduction in mean +/- standard deviation (SD) daily stool output (g) of children in the L-isoleucine group from day 2 but it was significant on day 3 (388 +/- 261 vs. 653 +/- 446; the difference between mean [95% confidence interval (CI) (-)265 (-509, -20); p = 0.035]. Although the cumulative stool output from day 1 to day 3 reduced by 26% in the isoleucine group, it was not significant.

This response was durable through week 26, at which time 61.3% (122 of 199; 95% confidence interval 54.2%-68.1%) achieved a PGA score of clear (0) or minimal (1). There were no unexpected side effects or safety concerns. This was an open-label, 26-week study; an incremental change of 1 PGA point, even mild to minimal, was considered clinically significant, as most psoriasis practitioners seek to achieve minimal psoriasis or clear skin.

The rationale for double insemination is to create the opportunity for a longer fertilization period as follicle rupture may occur over a wide interval (approximately 22-47 h) after hCG administration in ovarian hyperstimulation (OH) with intrauterine insemination (IUI) cycles. This randomized study evaluates the effectiveness of single versus double IUI in only OH cycles with multi-follicular development. We conducted a single center trial, 228 eligible patients were randomized for this study on the day of hCG. Only cycles with multi-follicular development without premature luteinization (progesterone levels >1 ng/ml on the day of hCG), were included in the study. Multi-follicular development has been defined as at least two dominant follicles reaching minimum > or = 15 mm diameter in which one of them is >17 mm. OH cycles with more than five dominant follicles (>15 mm in diameter) were excluded from the study. In the single IUI group (Group 1 = 112 patients) IUI was applied 36 h after the hCG injection and in the double IUI group (Group 2 = 114 patients) the first IUI was performed 18 h after hCG administration and the second IUI was performed 40 h after hCG administration. The primary end-point is to compare live birth rates (LBRs) between single and double IUI arms. LBRs were 10.7% (12/112 patients) in the single IUI group and 12.3% (14/114) in the double IUI group and the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.835, OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 0.51-2.64).

Hyperglycaemia is associated with poor outcomes from exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Glycaemic control could improve outcomes by reducing infection, inflammation and myopathy. Most patients with COPD are managed on the acute medical unit (AMU) outside intensive care (ICU). To determine the feasibility, safety and efficacy of tight glycaemic control in patients on an AMU. Prospective, non-randomised, phase II, single-arm study of tight glycaemic control in COPD patients with acute exacerbations and hyperglycaemia admitted to the AMU. Participants received intravenous, then subcutaneous, insulin to control blood glucose to 4.4-6.5 mmol/l. Tight glycaemic control was evaluated: feasibility, protocol adherence; acceptability, patient questionnaire; safety, frequency of hypoglycaemia (capillary blood glucose (CBG) <2.2 mmol/l and 2.2-3.3 mmol/l); efficacy, median CBG, fasting CBG, proportion of measurements/time in target range, glycaemic variability. were compared with 25 published ICU studies. Results 20 patients (10 females, age 71 \u00b1 9 years; forced expiratory volume in 1 s: 41 \u00b1 16% predicted) were recruited. Tight glycaemic control was feasible (78% CBG measurements and 89% of insulin-dose adjustments were adherent to protocol) and acceptable to patients. 0.2% CBG measurements were <2.2 mmol/l and 4.1% measurements 2.2-3.3 mmol/l. The study CBG and proportion of measurements/time in target range were similar to that of ICU studies, whereas the fasting CBG was lower, and the glycaemic variability was greater. Tight glycaemic control is feasible and has similar safety and efficacy on AMU to ICU. However, as more recent ICU studies have shown no benefit and possible harm from tight glycaemic control, alternative strategies for blood glucose control in COPD exacerbations should now be explored.

The study purpose was to quantify the performance of the first implantable leadless cardiac monitor (ICM) with dedicated AF detection capabilities. Patients (n=247) with an implanted ICM (Reveal XT, Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, Minn) who were likely to present with paroxysmal AF were selected. A special Holter device stored 46 hours of subcutaneously recorded ECG, ICM markers, and 2 surface ECG leads. The ICM automatic arrhythmia classification was compared with the core laboratory classification of the surface ECG. Of the 206 analyzable Holter recordings collected, 76 (37%) contained at least 1 episode of core laboratory classified AF. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for identifying patients with any AF were 96.1%, 85.4%, 79.3%, and 97.4%, respectively. The AF burden measured with the ICM was very well correlated with the reference value derived from the Holter (Pearson coefficient=0.97). The overall accuracy of the ICM for detecting AF was 98.5%.

The CAPACITY programme (studies 004 and 006) was designed to confirm the results of a phase 2 study that suggested that pirfenidone, a novel antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory drug, reduces deterioration in lung function in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In two concurrent trials (004 and 006), patients (aged 40-80 years) with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were randomly assigned to oral pirfenidone or placebo for a minimum of 72 weeks in 110 centres in Australia, Europe, and North America. In study 004, patients were assigned in a 2:1:2 ratio to pirfenidone 2403 mg/day, pirfenidone 1197 mg/day, or placebo; in study 006, patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to pirfenidone 2403 mg/day or placebo. The randomisation code (permuted block design) was computer generated and stratified by region. All study personnel were masked to treatment group assignment until after final database lock. Treatments were administered orally, 801 mg or 399 mg three times a day. The primary endpoint was change in percentage predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) at week 72. Analysis was by intention to treat. The studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00287729 and NCT00287716.

Anti-T-cell globulins (ATGs) might lower the incidence of GVHD. We did a prospective, randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 3 trial to compare standard GVHD prophylaxis with ciclosporin and methotrexate with or without anti-Jurkat ATG-Fresenius (ATG-F). Between May 26, 2003, and Feb 8, 2007, 202 patients with haematological malignancies were centrally randomly assigned using computer-generated centre-stratified block randomisation between treatment groups receiving ciclosporin and methotrexate with or without additional ATG-F. One patient in the ATG-F group did not undergo transplantation, thus 201 patients who underwent transplantation with peripheral blood (n=164; 82%) or bone marrow (n=37; 18%) grafts from unrelated donors after myeloablative conditioning were included in the full analysis set, and were analysed according to their randomly assigned treatment (ATG-F n=103, control n=98). The primary endpoint was severe acute GVHD (aGVHD) grade III-IV or death within 100 days of transplantation. The trial is registered with the numbers DRKS00000002 and NCT00655343. The number of patients in the ATG-F group who had severe aGVHD grade III-IV or who died within 100 days of transplantation was 12 and 10 (21.4%, 95% CI 13.4-29.3), respectively, compared with 24 and nine (33.7%, 24.3-43.0) patients, respectively, in the control group (adjusted odds ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.30-1.17; p=0.13).

There were no differences between treatment groups with regard to relapse, non-relapse mortality, overall survival, and mortality from infectious causes. The addition of ATG-F to GVHD prophylaxis with ciclosporin and methotrexate resulted in decreased incidence of acute and chronic GVHD without an increase in relapse or non-relapse mortality, and without compromising overall survival.

This was a double-blind, multicenter, randomized trial of hypertensive patients (N = 185) aged \u226518 years taking amlodipine 5 mg during the run-in treatment period but failed to achieve sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) <90 mm Hg. After randomization into the amlodipine/losartan 5/50 mg fixed-dose combination group (n = 92) and the amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy group (n = 93), treatment was maintained without dose escalation for 8 weeks. The noninferiority margin was prespecified as 4 mm Hg after 8 weeks of treatment for the difference of the average change in DBP between treatments. The primary efficacy evaluation of noninferiority was tested using a confidence interval approach with a 97.5% 1-sided lower confidence limit using the average difference in DBP measured at baseline and 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, the DBP of both groups decreased from baseline by 8.9 (6.1) and 9.4 (7.5) mm Hg, respectively (difference = -0.5 [6.9] mm Hg, 95% CI: -2.5 to 1.5). Secondary end points of reductions in DBP after 4 weeks (-8.1 [6.7] vs -9.9 [7.3] mm Hg, difference = -1.8 mm Hg, 95% CI: -3.9 to 0.2) and sitting systolic blood pressure after 4 (-10.2 [11.8] vs -12.8 [10.2] mm Hg, difference = -2.6 mm Hg, 95% CI: -5.9 to 0.6) and 8 weeks (-12.2 [11.0] vs -13.4 [11.3] mm Hg, difference = -1.2 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.4 to 2.1) were comparable between the 2 treatment groups. There were 38 adverse events in 20 patients (21.7%) in the amlodipine/losartan 5/50 mg fixed-dose combination group and 31 in 24 patients (26.1%) in the amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy group; most were mild. There were 7 adverse events in 6 patients (6.5%) related to treatment in the fixed-dose combination group and 13 in 10 patients (10.9%) in the monotherapy group (P = 0.30). Fixed-dose combination amlodipine/losartan 5/50 mg was not inferior in terms of reductions in DBP after 8 weeks of treatment and had comparable safety profile to amlodipine 10 mg in patients who did not respond to amlodipine 5 mg monotherapy.

Pertussis occurs in older children, adolescents and adults due to waning immunity after primary vaccination. Booster vaccination for pre-school children has been recommended in Italy since 1999. In this study (NCT00871000), the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of a booster dose of reduced-antigen content diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis-inactivated poliovirus vaccine (dTpa-IPV; GSK Biologicals Boostrix\u2122-Polio; 3-component pertussis) vs. full-strength DTPa-IPV vaccine (sanofi-pasteur--MSD Tetravac\u2122; 2-component pertussis) was evaluated in pre-school Italian children. Healthy children aged 5-6 y primed in a routine vaccination setting with three doses of DTPa-based vaccines were enrolled and randomized (1:1) in this phase IIIb, booster study to receive a single dose of dTpa-IPV or DTPa-IPV; the MMRV vaccine was co-administered. Antibody concentrations/titers against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and poliovirus 1-3 were measured before and one month post-booster. Reactogenicity and safety was assessed. 305 subjects were enrolled of whom 303 (dTpa-IPV = 151; DTPa-IPV = 152) received booster vaccination. One month post-booster, all subjects were seroprotected/seropositive for anti-diphtheria, anti-tetanus, anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-poliovirus 1-3; 99.3% of dTpa-IPV and 60.4% of DTPa-IPV subjects were seropositive for anti-PRN; 98-100% of subjects were seropositive against MMRV antigens post-booster. Pain at the injection site (dTpa-IPV: 63.6%; DTPa-IPV: 63.2%) and fatigue (dTpa-IPV: 26.5%; DTPa-IPV: 23.7%) were the most commonly reported solicited local and general symptoms, during the 4-d follow-up period. No SAEs or fatalities were reported. The reduced-antigen-content dTpa-IPV vaccine was non-inferior to full-strength DTPa-IPV vaccine with respect to immunogenicity.

Costs were quantified from the healthcare perspective. Non-parametric simulations were performed to quantify the uncertainty around the mean estimates and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were made. Systolic and diastolic daytime and night-time ambulatory BP (ABP) were reduced in both groups. The uncertainty around the incremental cost effectiveness ratio point estimates was considerable for both systolic and diastolic ABP. For systolic ABP, the difference in cost effectiveness ratio between the two groups was 256 Danish kroner (DKK)/mmHg [95% uncertainty interval, UI -860 to 4544]. For diastolic ABP, the difference in cost effectiveness ratio between the two groups was 655 DKK/mmHg [95% UI -674 to 69315]. Medication and consultation costs were lowest in the intervention group, but were offset by the cost of the telemonitoring equipment.

Twenty-one classrooms of 579 children aged 9-11 y were randomized to interventions with an equivalent content of vitamin D(3): 1) a one-time seasonal supplement of 13,700 IU, 2) 300 IU/d from supplements, 3) 300 IU/d from fortified ultra-high-temperature pasteurized milk from the United States, 4) 300 IU/d from fortified pasteurized Mongolian milk, or 5) unfortified pasteurized Mongolian milk (control). In January, the mean (\u00b1SD) serum 25(OH)D concentration was 8 \u00b1 4 ng/mL (20 \u00b1 10 nmol/L), and 98% of the children had a concentration <20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L).

Previous studies have shown disparities between Black and Hispanic patients compared with other populations in response to asthma medications. The aim of this analysis was to assess the effect of budesonide/formoterol pressurized metered-dose inhaler (BUD/FM pMDI) and BUD on predefined criteria for asthma worsening, an asthma control metric generally aligned with definitions of moderate asthma exacerbations, across four different populations. Data were from four 12-week, randomized, double-blind, US studies of BUD/FM pMDI treatment in patients aged 12 years or older with varying asthma severities and of varying races. Predefined asthma events and withdrawals due to predefined events were assessed as secondary study endpoints. Study I (NCT00651651) includes data from predominantly White patients with mild to moderate asthma who were randomized to BUD/FM pMDI 160/9\u2009\u03bcg twice daily (bid; n\u2009=\u2009123) or BUD pMDI 160\u2009\u03bcg bid (n\u2009=\u2009121). Study II (NCT00652002) includes data from predominantly White patients with moderate to severe asthma who were randomized to BUD/FM pMDI 320/9\u2009\u03bcg bid (n\u2009=\u2009124) or BUD pMDI 320\u2009\u03bcg bid (n\u2009=\u2009109).

Study IV (NCT00419757) included self-reported Hispanic patients with moderate to severe asthma who were randomized to BUD/FM pMDI 320/9\u2009\u03bcg bid (n\u2009=\u2009127) or BUD pMDI 320\u2009\u03bcg bid (n\u2009=\u2009123). Patients were to be withdrawn from the studies if they developed an asthma event, as determined by predefined criteria, except for night-time awakenings, where withdrawal was left to the study physician's judgment. Overall, fewer patients in the studies (study I, II, III, and IV, respectively) experienced \u22651 asthma event in the BUD/FM group (18.7%, 29.8%, 37.3%, 25.2%) versus the BUD group (21.5%, 44.0%, 45.3%, 31.7%); only study II results showed a statistically significant difference between treatments. Fewer patients with moderate to severe asthma (studies II, III, and IV) were withdrawn due to \u22651 asthma event in the BUD/FM group (10.5%, 11.8%, 3.1%, respectively) than in the BUD group (20.2%, 18.9%, 6.5%, respectively); however, percentages were similar in the BUD/FM (7.3%) and BUD (6.6%) groups in patients with mild to moderate asthma (study I). Predefined asthma event rates were numerically or significantly lower for patients with asthma receiving BUD/FM pMDI versus BUD, regardless of race or disease severity. Differences between the BUD/FM pMDI and BUD groups were smaller in patients with mild to moderate asthma than in those with moderate to severe asthma, most likely because patients with milder disease had lower asthma event rates. Overall, these findings support the efficacy of BUD/FM pMDI in achieving asthma control in patients with moderate to severe asthma.

Data on efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) to treat Plasmodium falciparum during pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa is scarce. A recent open label, randomized controlled trial in Mbarara, Uganda demonstrated that artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is not inferior to quinine to treat uncomplicated malaria in pregnancy. Haemozoin can persist in the placenta following clearance of parasites, however there is no data whether ACT can influence the amount of haemozoin or the dynamics of haemozoin clearance. Women attending antenatal clinics with weekly screening and positive blood smears by microscopy were eligible to participate in the trial and were followed to delivery. Placental haemozoin deposition and inflammation were assessed by histology. To determine whether AL was associated with increased haemozoin clearance, population haemozoin clearance curves were calculated based on the longitudinal data. Of 152 women enrolled in each arm, there were 97 and 98 placental biopsies obtained in the AL and quinine arms, respectively. AL was associated with decreased rates of moderate to high grade haemozoin deposition (13.3% versus 25.8%), which remained significant after correcting for gravidity, time of infection, re-infection, and parasitaemia.

Increasing worldwide development of antimicrobial resistance and the association of resistance development and antibiotic overuse make it necessary to seek strategies for safely reducing antibiotic use and selection pressure. In a first step, in a non-interventional study, the antibiotic prescription rates, initial procalcitonin (PCT) levels and outcome of 702 patients presenting with acute respiratory infection at 45 primary care physicians were observed. The second part was a randomised controlled non-inferiority trial comparing standard care with PCT-guided antimicrobial treatment in 550 patients in the same setting. Antibiotics were recommended at a PCT threshold of 0.25 ng\u00b7mL(-1). Clinical overruling was permitted. The primary end-point for non-inferiority was number of days with significant health impairment after 14 days. Antibiotics were prescribed in 30.3% of enrolled patients in the non-interventional study. In the interventional study, 36.7% of patients in the control group received antibiotics as compared to 21.5% in the PCT-guided group (41.6% reduction). In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, the numbers of days with significant health impairment were similar (mean 9.04 versus 9.00 for PCT-guided and control group, respectively; difference 0.04; 95% confidence interval -0.73-0.81). This was also true after adjusting for the most important confounders. In the PCT group, advice was overruled in 36 cases. There was no significant difference in primary end-point when comparing the PCT group treated as advised, the overruled PCT group and the control group (9.008 versus 9.250 versus 9.000 days; p = 0.9605). A simple one-point PCT measurement for guiding decisions on antibiotic treatment is non-inferior to standard treatment in terms of safety, and effectively reduced the antibiotic treatment rate by 41.6%.

A phase I study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) and the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of pemetrexed and docetaxel in patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients were treated with escalating doses of pemetrexed (400-600 mg/m(2) as a 10-min intravenous infusion) and docetaxel (65-85 mg/m(2) as a 1-h intravenous infusion) on day 1, every 3 weeks. An expanded accrual at the level of the recommended dose (RD) had been scheduled. Forty-two patients with metastatic NSCLC were enrolled in the phase I study and 20 additional patients at the RD level. The MTD could not be reached even at the doses of 550 and 85 mg/m(2) for pemetrexed and docetaxel, respectively, which are higher than the recommended dose for each drug given as a single agent. Therefore, the RD was defined at 500 mg/m(2) pemetrexed and 75 mg/m(2) docetaxel. Among the 164 administered chemotherapy cycles (phase I part), there were three episodes of febrile neutropenia whereas 13 (7.9%) and 11 (6.7%) cycles were complicated with grade III and IV neutropenia, respectively. Three patients developed grade III/IV thrombocytopenia. Non-hematologic toxicity was mild with grade III fatigue occurring in three (6.7%) patients. There was no toxic death. The favorable toxicity profile of the regimen was confirmed in patients treated at the RD level. Overall, one complete (CR) and 13 partial responses (PR) (overall response rate = 23; 95% C.I:12.4-33.5%] were documented.

The purpose of this pooled analysis was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of exenatide BID in patients stratified by various demographic characteristics. This post hoc analysis included data from 16 randomized controlled trials in which patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were treated with 10-\u03bcg exenatide BID. Each patient was classified into subgroups on the basis of his or her baseline values for age (< 65 or \u2265 65 years), sex (male or female), race (white, black, Asian, or Hispanic), duration of diabetes (< 10 years or \u2265 10 years), and body mass index (BMI; \u2265 20 to < 25, \u2265 25 to < 30, \u2265 30 to < 35, or \u2265 35 kg/m(2)).

All groups experienced significant improvements in glycated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose levels (other than black patients, who had a relatively low baseline fasting plasma glucose level), and body weight from baseline to endpoint. Most groups had significant improvements in systolic blood pressure. All of the age, sex, and duration of diabetes groups experienced significant improvements in lipid levels (other than high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). Whites and Asians generally experienced significant improvements in lipid levels, whereas blacks and Hispanics did not. Significant improvements in lipid levels were generally seen across BMI groups.

PBT2 is a metal-protein attenuating compound (MPAC) that affects the Cu2(+)-mediated and Zn2(+)-mediated toxic oligomerisation of Abeta seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Strong preclinical efficacy data and the completion of early, clinical safety studies have preceded this phase IIa study, the aim of which was to assess the effects of PBT2 on safety, efficacy, and biomarkers of AD. Between December 6, 2006, and September 21, 2007, community-dwelling patients over age 55 years were recruited to this 12-week, double-blind, randomised trial of PBT2. Patients were randomly allocated to receive 50 mg PBT2, 250 mg PBT2, or placebo. Inclusion criteria were early AD (mini-mental state examination [MMSE] score between 20 and 26 points or Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) score between 10 and 25 points), taking a stable dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil, galantamine, or rivastigmine) for at least 4 months, a modified Hachinski score of 4 points or less, and CT or MRI results that were consistent with AD. The principal outcomes were safety and tolerability. Secondary outcomes were plasma and CSF biomarkers and cognition. Analysis was intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00471211. 78 patients were randomly assigned (29 to placebo, 20 to PBT2 50 mg, and 29 to PBT2 250 mg) and 74 (95%) completed the study. 42 (54%) patients had at least one treatment emergent adverse event (10 [50%] on PBT2 50 mg, 18 [62%] on PBT2 250 mg, and 14 [48%] on placebo). No serious adverse events were reported by patients on PBT2. Patients treated with PBT2 250 mg had a dose-dependent (p=0.023) and significant reduction in CSF Abeta(42) concentration compared with those treated with placebo (difference in least squares mean change from baseline was -56.0 pg/mL, 95% CI -101.5 to -11.0; p=0.006). PBT2 had no effect on plasma biomarkers of AD or serum Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) concentrations. Cognition testing included ADAS-cog, MMSE, and a neuropsychological test battery (NTB). Of these tests, two executive function component tests of the NTB showed significant improvement over placebo in the PBT2 250 mg group: category fluency test (2.8 words, 0.1 to 5.4; p=0.041) and trail making part B (-48.0 s, -83.0 to -13.0; p=0.009). The safety profile is favourable for the ongoing development of PBT2. The effect on putative biomarkers for AD in CSF but not in plasma is suggestive of a central effect of the drug on Abeta metabolism. Cognitive efficacy was restricted to two measures of executive function.

Significantly greater proportions of patients receiving alogliptin 12.5 or 25 mg than placebo had HbA(1C) decreases of > or =0.5, > or =1.0 and > or =1.5%. Insulin doses remained unchanged, and there were no differences in the proportions of patients experiencing hypoglycaemia among placebo (24%), alogliptin 12.5 mg (27%) and alogliptin 25 mg (27%). Mean weight increases from baseline at week 26 were similar for placebo (0.6 +/- 0.2 kg), alogliptin 12.5 mg (0.7 +/- 0.2 kg) and alogliptin 25 mg (0.6 +/- 0.2 kg). Incidences of overall adverse events, and of gastrointestinal, dermatological and infection-related events, were similar among groups. Adding alogliptin to previous insulin therapy (with or without metformin) significantly improved glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on insulin, without causing weight gain or increasing the incidence of hypoglycaemia. Further studies are warranted to explore the role of alogliptin added to optimized basal insulin regimens.

A total of 463 patients undergoing CTI ablation in 19 clinical centres were randomized to receive the treatment by gold-tip or control catheter. The primary endpoint was cumulative radiofrequency (RF) application duration until achieving bidirectional CTI block. It did not differ significantly for the two catheters. The gold-tip catheter was, however, associated with a higher ablation success rate (94.3 vs. 89.0%, P = 0.042) and a substantially lower incidence of char and coagulum formation (4.8 vs. 37.9%, P < 0.001), which required exchange of 1 gold-tip (0.4%) and 10 control catheters (4.6%, P = 0.005). The gold-tip catheter delivered more mean power (52 \u00b1 12 W) than the control catheter (48 \u00b1 13 W, P < 0.001).

Postprandial release of intact proinsulin (IP) is an independent marker for beta-cell dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes. This open-label, parallel-group, two-arm, pilot study compared the beta-cell protective effect of adding insulin glargine (GLA) vs. NPH insulin to ongoing metformin. Overall, 28 insulin-naive type 2 diabetes subjects (mean +/- SD age, 61.5 +/- 6.7 years; diabetes duration, 9.8 +/- 6.5 years; HbA1c, 7.1 +/- 0.5%; BMI, 30.7 +/- 4.3 kg/m(2)) treated with metformin and sulfonylurea were randomized to add once-daily GLA or NPH at bedtime. At baseline and after 3 months, subjects received a standardized breakfast, lunch and dinner, with pre- and postprandial blood sampling to measure plasma IP, total insulin and blood glucose (BG). Insulin dose after 3 months was comparable in both groups (GLA vs. NPH: 23.6 +/- 13.4 vs. 23.3 +/- 12.7; p = NS ). Both treatments significantly reduced fasting BG levels (GLA: 158 +/- 19 to 121 +/- 23 mg/dl; NPH: 156 +/- 34 to 119 +/- 29 mg/dl; both p < 0.01 vs. baseline). Fasting and postprandial BG levels did not differ between groups. IP levels decreased in both groups (p < 0.05 at all timepoints). Although IP release after breakfast did not differ between treatments, GLA induced a greater reduction in IP release after lunch (p = 0.08) and dinner (p = 0.04). Total plasma insulin levels did not differ between groups. Adding basal insulin to metformin reduces postprandial beta-cell load. While GLA and NPH had comparable effects at breakfast, GLA reduces beta-cell stress more effectively at dinner, and with a trend at lunch, most probably because of its longer lasting pharmacodynamic profile.

The standard measure of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) efficacy in treating exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA). CFA measurement involves 72-hour stool collection, which presents a logistical challenge because, although the test may be performed on an outpatient basis in clinical practice, hospitalization is needed if assurance of complete collection and 100% compliance is required, for example, in controlled situations such as clinical trials. Our aim was to investigate sparse stool sample collection as an alternative to complete 72-hour collection for measurement of stool fat in subjects with EPI. Prospective data analysis from a previously published, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 2-period crossover trial in subjects ages 7 to 11 years with EPI caused by cystic fibrosis. Percentage fat (PF) data from sparse stool samples were compared with 72-hour CFA values as a dichotomous variable (<80%, \u226580%), with evaluation of sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. Area under the curve values were obtained from receiver operating characteristic plots of sensitivity versus 1-specificity. Twelve subjects provided samples for this analysis.

AEs were variable in nature, and no dose-dependent trends were observed. The frequency of infection-related AEs was similar across treatments. No notable effect of treatment on immunization status (protective versus nonprotective titer) was observed after initiation of treatment. This study did not meet the primary efficacy end point. However, clear biologic activity consistent with the proposed mechanism of action was observed. The results suggest that decreasing the expression of RF may not be sufficient to induce clinical improvement in RA. The safety of atacicept was considered acceptable in this patient population.

This study evaluated the regulation and function of micro-RNAs (miRs) in bone marrow-mononuclear cells (BMCs). Although cell therapy with BMCs may represent a therapeutic option to treat patients with heart disease, the impaired functionality of patient-derived cells remains a major challenge. Small noncoding miRs post-transcriptionally control gene expression patterns and play crucial roles in modulating cell survival and function. Micro-RNAs were detected by miR profiling in BMCs isolated from healthy volunteers (n = 6) or from patients with myocardial infarction (n = 6), and the results were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a larger cohort (n = 37). The function of selected miRs was determined by gain-of-function studies in vitro and by locked nuclear acid (LNA) modified inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. We identified several miRs that are up-regulated in BMCs from patients with myocardial infarction compared with BMCs from healthy controls, including the pro-apoptotic and antiproliferative miR-34a and the hypoxia-controlled miR-210. Inhibition of miR-34 by LNA-34a significantly reduced miR-34a expression and blocked hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death of BMC in vitro, whereas overexpression of miR-34a reduced the survival of BMCs in vitro. Pre-treatment of BMCs with LNA-34a ex vivo significantly increased the therapeutic benefit of transplanted BMCs in mice after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). These results demonstrate that cardiovascular disease modulates the miR expression of BMCs in humans. Reducing the expression of the pro-apoptotic miR-34a improves the survival of BMCs in vitro and enhances the therapeutic benefit of cell therapy in mice after AMI.

For patients with sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) restenosis requiring reintervention, we compared a strategy of repeat SES (Cypher, Cordis, Miami Lakes, Florida) implantation with paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) (Taxus, Boston Scientific, Natick, Massachusetts) implantation. Despite their high anti-restenotic efficacy, the widespread utilization of SES therapy has led to a significant absolute number of patients presenting with SES treatment failure. The optimal treatment strategy for such patients remains unclear. The ISAR-DESIRE 2 (Intracoronary Stenting and Angiographic Results: Drug Eluting Stents for In-Stent Restenosis 2) study was a randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial conducted among 450 patients with clinically significant in-SES restenosis at 2 centers in Munich, Germany. After pre-treatment with 600 mg clopidogrel, all patients were randomly assigned to either SES or PES implantation. The primary end point was late lumen loss, based on in-stent analysis, at 6- to 8-month follow-up angiography. Secondary end points were binary angiographic restenosis (diameter stenosis >50%) at 6- to 8-month follow-up, target lesion revascularization, the composite of death or myocardial infarction, and definite stent thrombosis at 12 months. Regarding anti-restenotic efficacy, there were no differences between SES and PES in late loss (0.40 +/- 0.65 mm vs. 0.38 +/- 0.59 mm; p = 0.85), binary restenosis (19.6% vs. 20.6%; p = 0.69), or target lesion revascularization (16.6% vs. 14.6%; p = 0.52). In terms of safety outcomes, the rates of death/myocardial infarction (6.1% vs. 5.8%; p = 0.86) and stent thrombosis (0.4% vs. 0.4%; p > 0.99) were also similar.

The primary endpoint was trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (mean of 23 h 15 min and 23 h 45 min post-dose values) on day 7. Other endpoints included trough FEV1 on day 1, individual time point FEV1 and monitoring and recording of all adverse events. A total of 135 (87.7%) patients completed the study (all randomly assigned patients: mean age 61.7 years, 61.4% male, post-bronchodilator FEV1 52.2% predicted, FEV1/forced vital capacity 47.6%). The estimated treatment difference (95% CI) for trough FEV1 on day 7 between QVA149 and placebo was 226 ml (192 to 260; p<0.001). The estimated treatment difference between QVA149 and indacaterol 300 and 600 \u03bcg was 123 ml (89 to 157; p<0.001) and 117 ml (83 to 150; p<0.001), respectively. The improvements in mean trough FEV1 exceeded the predefined minimal clinically important differences of 100\u2013140 ml for QVA149 versus placebo and indacaterol. Similar results were observed on day 1. All treatments were well tolerated. QVA149 demonstrated rapid and sustained bronchodilation with significant improvements compared with indacaterol monotherapy and placebo in patients with COPD. NCT00570778.

Our aim was to test silodosin's superiority to placebo and noninferiority to tamsulosin and discuss the findings in the context of a comprehensive literature review of the new compound silodosin. We conducted a multicenter double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled parallel group study. A total of 1228 men \u226550 yr of age with an International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) \u226513 and a urine maximum flow rate (Q(max)) >4 and \u226415 ml/s were selected at 72 sites in 11 European countries. The patients were entered into a 2-wk wash-out and a 4-wk placebo run-in period. A total of 955 patients were randomized (2:2:1) to silodosin 8 mg (n=381), tamsulosin 0.4 mg (n=384), or placebo (n=190) once daily for 12 wk. We calculated the change from baseline in IPSS total score (primary), storage and voiding subscores, quality of life (QoL) due to urinary symptoms, and Q(max). Responders were defined on the basis of IPSS and Q(max) by a decrease of \u226525% and an increase of \u226530% from baseline, respectively. The change from baseline in the IPSS total score with silodosin and tamsulosin was significantly superior to that with placebo (p<0.001): difference active placebo of -2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], -3.2, -1.4) with silodosin and -2.0 (95% CI,-2.9, -1.1) with tamsulosin. Responder rates according to total IPSS were significantly higher (p<0.001) with silodosin (66.8%) and tamsulosin (65.4%) than with placebo (50.8%). Active treatments were also superior to placebo in the IPSS storage and voiding subscore analyses, as well as in QoL due to urinary symptoms. Of note, only silodosin significantly reduced nocturia versus placebo (the change from baseline was -0.9, -0.8, and -0.7 for silodosin, tamsulosin, and placebo, respectively; p=0.013 for silodosin vs placebo). An increase in Q(max) was observed in all groups. The adjusted mean change from baseline to end point was 3.77 ml/s for silodosin, 3.53 ml/s for tamsulosin, and 2.93 ml/s for placebo, but the change for silodosin and tamsulosin was not statistically significant versus placebo because of a particularly high placebo response (silodosin vs placebo: p=0.089; tamsulosin vs placebo: p=0.221). At end point, the percentage of responders by Q(max) was 46.6%, 46.5%, and 40.5% in the silodosin, tamsulosin, and placebo treatment groups, respectively. This difference was not statistically significantly (p=0.155 silodosin vs placebo and p=0.141 tamsulosin vs placebo). Active treatments were well tolerated, and discontinuation rates due to adverse events were low in all groups (2.1%, 1.0%, and 1.6% with silodosin, tamsulosin, and placebo, respectively). The most frequent adverse event with silodosin was a reduced or absent ejaculation during orgasm (14%), a reversible effect as a consequence of the potent and selective \u03b1(1A)-adrenoreceptor antagonism of the drug.

This was a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind study conducted in 190 patients with T2DM. After >or= 6 weeks of stable metformin monotherapy (>or= 1500 mg/day), patients were randomized to either the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or placebo to ongoing metformin for 30 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was reduction in hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) measured after 18 weeks of sitagliptin treatment. Key secondary endpoints included reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-hour (2-h) postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) at 18 weeks, and HbA(1c) at 30 weeks. The proportion of patients meeting the goal of HbA(1c) < 7.0% was also analyzed. Sitagliptin significantly reduced HbA(1c), FPG, and 2-h PPG, compared with placebo (all p < 0.001). The net improvement in HbA(1c) was - 1.0% at both 18 and 30 weeks, and a significantly greater proportion of patients treated with sitagliptin achieved HbA(1c) < 7.0% by the end of the study (22.1% vs. 3.3%, p < 0.001). Sitagliptin was well-tolerated. Compared with placebo, sitagliptin had a neutral effect on body weight and did not significantly increase the risk of hypoglycemia or gastrointestinal adverse events.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) and chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) are common causes of substantial illness and disability in preschool children. Antihistamines are commonly used to treat preschool children with these conditions, but their use is based mostly on extrapolated efficacy from adult populations; it is thus important to characterize the safety of antihistamines in the pediatric population. This study was designed to assess the safety of levocetirizine dihydrochloride oral liquid drops in infants and children with AR or CIU. Two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group studies randomized infants aged 6-11 months (study 1, n = 69) and children aged 1-5 years (study 2, n = 173) to levocetirizine, 1.25 mg (q.d. or b.i.d., respectively), or placebo for 2 weeks, using a 2:1 ratio. Safety evaluations included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital signs, electrocardiographic (ECG) assessments, and laboratory tests. The overall incidence of TEAEs was similar between levocetirizine and placebo in both studies. Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity. TEAEs prompted discontinuation of therapy in three patients receiving levocetirizine in study 1. No clinically relevant changes from baseline in vital signs or laboratory parameters were apparent in either study; changes from baseline in these evaluations were similar between groups. No significant changes were observed in ECG parameters, including corrected QT interval.

In this multicenter, double-blind trial, 340 patients presenting to the intensive care unit (ICU) with an onset of severe ARDS within the previous 48 hours were randomly assigned to receive, for 48 hours, either cisatracurium besylate (178 patients) or placebo (162 patients). Severe ARDS was defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) of less than 150, with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm or more of water and a tidal volume of 6 to 8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who died either before hospital discharge or within 90 days after study enrollment (i.e., the 90-day in-hospital mortality rate), adjusted for predefined covariates and baseline differences between groups with the use of a Cox model. The hazard ratio for death at 90 days in the cisatracurium group, as compared with the placebo group, was 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48 to 0.98; P=0.04), after adjustment for both the baseline PaO2:FIO2 and plateau pressure and the Simplified Acute Physiology II score.

In this combined analysis of four clinical trials we assessed the effect of prophylactic HPV vaccination on these diseases. 20,583 women aged 16-26 years were randomised to receive quadrivalent HPV6/11/16/18 vaccine (n=9087), its HPV16 vaccine component (n=1204), or placebo (n=10 292). They underwent periodic Papanicolaou testing, with colposcopy or biopsy for detected abnormalities. The primary composite endpoint was the combined incidence of HPV16/18-related CIN2/3, AIS, or cervical cancer. These trials are registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00365378, NCT00365716, NCT00092521, and NCT00092534. Mean follow-up was 3.0 years (SD 0.66) after first dose. In women negative for HPV16 or HPV18 infection during the vaccination regimen (n=17 129, per protocol), vaccine efficacy was 99% for the primary endpoint (95% CI 93-100), meeting the statistical criterion for success. In an intention-to-treat analysis of all randomised women (including those who were HPV16/18 naive or HPV16/18-infected at day 1), efficacy was 44% (95% CI 31-55); all but one case in vaccine recipients occurred in women infected with HPV16 or HPV18 before vaccination.

Methods and results Patients with a successful PCI for a first STEMI were randomized to receive either standard medical care alone, or in combination with a single bolus with 60,000 IU i.v. of epoetin alfa within 3 h after PCI. Primary endpoint was left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) after 6 weeks, assessed by planar radionuclide ventriculography. Pre-specified secondary endpoints included enzymatic infarct size and major adverse cardiovascular events. A total of 529 patients were enrolled (EPO n = 263, control n = 266). At baseline (before EPO administration), groups were well-matched for all relevant characteristics. After a mean of 6.5 (\u00b1 2.0) weeks, LVEF was 0.53 (\u00b1 0.10) in the EPO group and 0.52 (\u00b1 0.11) in the control group (P = 0.41).

Recent experimental studies reveal that, among animals with sustained pressure overload, those with insulin resistance induced by a high-carbohydrate/high-fat diet have more severe LV hypertrophy and dysfunction compared to animals fed with standard diet. Among the 272 patients who were recruited in the ASTRONOMER (Aortic Stenosis Progression Observation Measuring Effects of Rosuvastatin) study, none had hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, or coronary artery disease (exclusion criteria) at baseline. However, 33% had systemic hypertension and 27% had MetS as identified by the National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III, clinical criteria. Patients with MetS had higher LV mass index (53 +/- 14 g/m(2.7) vs. 47 +/- 15 g/m(2.7); p = 0.002), relative wall thickness ratio (0.47 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.42 +/- 0.09; p = 0.001), and prevalence of LV concentric hypertrophy (42% vs. 23%) and lower peak early diastolic (8.2 +/- 2.4 cm/s vs. 9.6 +/- 3.1 cm/s, p = 0.001) and peak systolic (7.9 +/- 1.7 cm/s vs. 8.7 +/- 2.2 cm/s, p = 0.009) mitral annular myocardial velocities compared to patients without MetS. After adjustment for age, sex, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertension, and valvuloarterial impedance (i.e., global LV hemodynamic load), MetS was independently associated with higher relative wall thickness ratio (p = 0.01), higher prevalence of concentric hypertrophy (p = 0.03), and reduced diastolic (p = 0.01) and systolic (p = 0.03) myocardial velocities. Notwithstanding AS severity and increase in hemodynamic load, MetS is independently associated with more pronounced LV concentric hypertrophy and worse myocardial function in patients with AS, which may, in turn, predispose them to the occurrence of adverse events.

The etonogestrel (ENG)-releasing implant is a subdermal progestogen-only contraceptive that provides coverage for up to 3 years. This long-acting hormonal contraceptive has been available in Europe since 1998 and in the US since 2006. To date, localization of non-palpable implants at insertion and before removal has been dependent on ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging by an experienced clinician. To facilitate localization in rare cases of non-palpable implants using widely available equipment without the need for a specialist, a radiopaque ENG implant has been developed that is detectable by two-dimensional x-ray imaging. This study aimed to establish whether the radiopaque ENG implant is bioequivalent in situ compared with the original non-radiopaque ENG implant, and to assess x-ray visibility of the radiopaque ENG implant. This was a 3-year, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study carried out in nine international clinical trial centres. Women aged 18-40 years at the time of screening, with menstrual cycles of a usual length of 24-35 days and a body mass index of between \u226518 and \u226429\u2009kg/m(2) were included. Women were assigned to either the radiopaque or non-radiopaque ENG implant in a 1\u2009:\u20091 ratio via a block randomization by centre. Bioequivalence testing was performed based on the peak ENG concentration (C(max)), and the area under the curve (AUC) for ENG at 6, 24 and 36 months (AUC(6\u2009mo), AUC(24\u2009mo) and AUC(36\u2009mo)) after insertion. For this purpose, blood sampling for pharmacokinetic determination was performed prior to insertion and for up to 3 years afterwards. Bioequivalence was defined as the 90% confidence interval (CI) of the ratio radiopaque implant/non-radiopaque implant of the geometric means (GMR) within the acceptance range of 0.80-1.25. x-Ray visibility was assessed by two-dimensional x-ray imaging after insertion and before removal of the implant. The pharmacokinetic profiles of ENG indicated that the radiopaque and non-radiopaque implants were bioequivalent with respect to the geometric mean of C(max) (GMR 1.06; 90% CI 0.91, 1.23), AUC(6\u2009mo) (GMR 1.00; 90% CI 0.91, 1.10), AUC(24\u2009mo) (GMR 0.98; 90% CI 0.88, 1.10) and AUC(36\u2009mo) (GMR 1.00; 90% CI 0.89, 1.11). The radiopaque ENG implant was clearly visible in 50 out of 52 women after insertion and in all 52 women before removal, whereas none of the non-radiopaque implants were visible.

We investigated the physical safety of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) utilizing imaginal exposure in patients who suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following a life-threatening cardiovascular event. In this phase I, prospective, single-blind trial conducted from April 2006 through April 2008, we randomly assigned 60 patients to receive either 3 to 5 sessions of imaginal exposure therapy (experimental group) or 1 to 3 educational sessions only (control group). Criteria for PTSD and other mental health disorders were evaluated according to DSM-IV using the full Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). Safety assessments included patients' blood pressure and pulse before and after each study session and the occurrence of deaths, hospitalizations, repeat myocardial infarctions, or invasive procedures. We also investigated the effects of the treatment on PTSD symptoms (Impact of Event Scale and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale), depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II), and the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) scale. There were no significant differences between the experimental and control groups and between exposure and nonexposure sessions in any of the safety measures. In addition, confidence intervals were such that the nonsignificant effects of exposure therapy were not of clinical concern. For example, the mean difference in systolic pressure between control and exposure sessions was 0.5 mm Hg (95% CI, -6.1 to 7.1 mm Hg). Nonsignificant improvements were found on all psychiatric measures in the experimental group, with a significant improvement in CGI-S in the entire cohort (mean score difference, -0.6; 95% CI, -1.1 to -0.1; P = .02) and a significant improvement in PTSD symptoms in a subgroup of patients with acute unscheduled cardiovascular events and high baseline PTSD symptoms (mean score difference, -1.2; 95% CI, -2.0 to -0.3; P = .01).

These effects may have resulted from changes within the lung (reduced lung water content and improved alveolar-capillary gas conductance, +15.8\u00b14.5%), the pulmonary vasculature (arteriolar resistance, -71.0\u00b18.2%), and left-sided cardiac function (wedge pulmonary pressure, -15.7\u00b13.1%; cardiac index, +6.0\u00b10.9%; deceleration time, -13.0\u00b11.9%; isovolumic relaxation time, -14.0\u00b11.7%; septal mitral annulus velocity, -76.4\u00b19.2%). Results were similar at 12 months. The multifaceted response to phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction includes improvement in pulmonary pressure and vasomotility, RV function and dimension, left ventricular relaxation and distensibility (structural changes and/or ventricular interdependence), and lung interstitial water metabolism (wedge pulmonary pressure decrease improving hydrostatic balance and right atrial pressure reduction facilitating lung lymphatic drainage). These results enhance our understanding of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and offer new directions for therapy. URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. UNIQUE IDENTIFIER: NCT01156636.

Studies of the efficacy of vitamin C treatment for fatigue have yielded inconsistent results. One of the reasons for this inconsistency could be the difference in delivery routes. Therefore, we planned a clinical trial with intravenous vitamin C administration. We evaluated the effect of intravenous vitamin C on fatigue in office workers. A group of 141 healthy volunteers, aged 20 to 49 years participated in this randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. The trial group received 10 grams of vitamin C with normal saline intravenously, while the placebo group received normal saline only. Since vitamin C is a well-known antioxidant, oxidative stress was measured. Fatigue score, oxidative stress, and plasma vitamin C levels were measured before intervention, and again two hours and one day after intervention. Adverse events were monitored. The fatigue scores measured at two hours after intervention and one day after intervention were significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.004); fatigue scores decreased in the vitamin C group after two hours and remained lower for one day. Trial also led to higher plasma vitamin C levels and lower oxidative stress compared to the placebo group (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). When data analysis was refined by dividing each group into high-baseline and low-baseline subgroups, it was observed that fatigue was reduced in the lower baseline vitamin C level group after two hours and after one day (p = 0.004). The same did not hold for the higher baseline group (p = 0.206). Thus, intravenous vitamin C reduced fatigue at two hours, and the effect persisted for one day. There were no significant differences in adverse events between two groups. High dose intravenous vitamin C proved to be safe and effective against fatigue in this study.

Preliminary clinical evidence indicates that menopausal status might impact on the efficacy of certain classes of antidepressants. The aim of this study was to evaluate open-label desvenlafaxine treatment (administered as desvenlafaxine succinate) in postmenopausal women who did not achieve clinical response to acute, double-blind treatment with desvenlafaxine or escitalopram. This phase IIIb, multicentre study included a 6-month open-label extension phase of patients who did not respond in the initial 8-week, randomized, double-blind acute phase. Postmenopausal women aged 40-70 years with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder were recruited. PRIMARY INTERVENTION: Non-responders to acute treatment with double-blind desvenlafaxine or escitalopram received flexible-dose, open-label desvenlafaxine 100-200\u2009mg/day for the 6-month extension phase. The primary efficacy assessment was the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D(17)) total score. Secondary efficacy outcome measures were the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) and -Severity scales, Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report, Visual Analogue Scale-Pain Intensity and the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Secondary health assessments were the Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire, 5-Dimension EuroQoL Index, Health State Today, Menopause Rating Scale, Sheehan Disability Scale, treatment response (\u2265 50% decrease in total HAM-D(17) and MADRS score from acute-phase baseline and CGI-I total score \u2264 2), HAM-D(17) remission (total score \u2264 7) and safety. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize outcomes. The efficacy analysis included 123 patients (desvenlafaxine/desvenlafaxine\u2009=\u200964; escitalopram/desvenlafaxine\u2009=\u200959). At final evaluation of the open-label extension phase, mean reductions from acute-phase baseline in HAM-D(17) total scores were -11.33 for the desvenlafaxine/desvenlafaxine group and -11.41 for the escitalopram/desvenlafaxine group. HAM-D(17) response or remission after 6 months of open-label extension phase desvenlafaxine treatment were achieved in 56-58% and 41-48% of patients, respectively. The results of the other secondary efficacy outcome measures and other definitions of treatment response were generally consistent with the primary analyses. The observed adverse events were similar to those reported during previous desvenlafaxine clinical trials. Postmenopausal women with major depressive disorder who did not respond to acute, double-blind treatment with escitalopram or desvenlafaxine achieved modest, continued improvement with long-term, open-label desvenlafaxine therapy. Further interpretation of these findings is limited by aspects of the study design (i.e. open-label, non-placebo-controlled) and the lack of randomized comparison groups in the extension phase, which prevents statistical assessment of the efficacy of longer term treatment with desvenlafaxine.

At 3 and 6 months post-therapy, clinical success rates were clinically higher for the 500-mg, 4-week treatment group, and statistical analysis demonstrated both groups were not noninferior to standard therapy with levofloxacin 500 mg (95% CI, -32.5%, -0.6% for both 750-mg groups at 6 months). NIH-CPSI scores showed similar trends. Overall, adverse event (AE) rates were similar for the three treatment groups; however, discontinuation of therapy due to AEs was higher with the 750-mg dose (p = 0.02, and p = 0.13 for 750 mg, 2 weeks and 750 mg, 3 weeks versus 500 mg for 4 weeks, respectively). The main limitation of this study was that no bacterial cultures were required. Higher doses for shorter durations were determined to be no worse than standard therapy with levofloxacin 500 mg for a longer duration at the TOC visit. However, at the 6-month follow-up visit, the levofloxacin 750-mg dose administered for either 2 weeks or 3 weeks was inferior to the standard therapy, suggesting that a longer duration of treatment may help extend the relapse-free interval in patients with CBP. clinicaltrials.gov, nct00402688.

Efficacy variables were change in msDBP and msSBP from baseline to endpoint (54-week and 80-week). Safety was assessed by monitoring and recording adverse events (AEs). ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00386607 RESULTS: A total of 601 patients (msDBP \u2265 90 and <110 mmHg) entered the 54-week core study. Optional add-on HCT was allowed at week 10 onwards if BP was \u2265 140/90 mmHg at two consecutive visits. Of the 486 patients completed the core study, 180 patients entered the extension phase and received aliskiren/valsartan and add-on HCT (12.5 or 25 mg). Overall the combination of aliskiren/valsartan was well-tolerated and the majority of AEs were mild-to-moderate in severity. The incidence of SAEs was low (core phase: n = 22 [3.7%]; extension phase: n = 4 [2.2%]). Elevated serum potassium (>5.5 mmol/L at any time during the study) was observed in 21 (3.6%) patients. The majority of these elevations were transient and returned to normal in subsequent visits, and the discontinuation rate due to elevated serum potassium was low (0.3% [n = 2]). Decreased serum potassium levels (<3.5 mmol/L at any time during the study) was observed in 26 (4.4%) patients, mainly in patients receiving aliskiren/valsartan/HCT (n = 22; 7.1%). At the 54-week endpoint, a mean BP reduction of 20.5/13.4 mmHg from baseline (baseline BP: 152.9/97.0 mmHg) was observed and 66.9% (n = 398/595) of patients achieved BP control with aliskiren/valsartan with or without HCT. At the end of the extension phase (80-week endpoint), additional reduction in BP was obtained (overall, 28.8/18.3 mmHg) and 86.6% (n = 155/179) of patients achieved BP control with aliskiren/valsartan/HCT. A limitation is the absence of an active comparator group. Long-term treatment with the combination of aliskiren/valsartan with or without HCT provided clinically meaningful BP reductions and high rates of BP control and was well-tolerated.

In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study, we evaluate the efficacy and safety of one-time injections of botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA) in Japanese patients with post-stroke lower limb spasticity. One hundred twenty patients with lower limb spasticity were randomized to a single treatment with BoNTA 300 U or placebo. The tone of the ankle flexor was assessed at baseline and through 12 weeks using the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). Gait pattern and speed of gait were also assessed. The primary endpoint was area under the curve (AUC) of the change from baseline in the MAS ankle score. Significant improvement in spasticity with BoNTA 300 U was demonstrated by a mean difference in the AUC of the change from baseline in the MAS ankle score between the BoNTA and placebo groups (-3.428; 95% CIs, -5.841 to -1.016; p = 0.006; t test). A significantly greater decrease from baseline in the MAS ankle score was noted at weeks 4, 6 and 8 in the BoNTA group compared to the placebo group (p < 0.001).

The second study was a crossover trial involving 22 subjects with hereditary angioedema that compared prophylactic twice-weekly injections of nanofiltered C1 inhibitor concentrate (1000 units) with placebo during two 12-week periods. The primary end point was the number of attacks of angioedema per period, with each subject acting as his or her own control. In the first study, the median time to the onset of unequivocal relief from an attack was 2 hours in the subjects treated with C1 inhibitor concentrate but longer than 4 hours in those given placebo (P=0.02). In the second study, the number of attacks per 12-week period was 6.26 with C1 inhibitor concentrate given as prophylaxis, as compared with 12.73 with placebo (P<0.001); the subjects who received the C1 inhibitor concentrate also had significant reductions in both the severity and the duration of attacks, in the need for open-label rescue therapy, and in the total number of days with swelling. In subjects with hereditary angioedema, nanofiltered C1 inhibitor concentrate shortened the duration of acute attacks.

Age-related alterations in metabolism and excretion of medications increase the risk of adverse drug events in the elderly. Inappropriate polypharmacy and prescription practice entails increased burdens of impaired quality of life and drug related morbidity and mortality. The main objective of this trial is to evaluate effects of a tailored educational intervention towards general practitioners (GPs) aimed at supporting the implementation of a safer drug prescribing practice for elderly patients > or = 70 years. Approximately 80 peer continuing medical education (CME) groups (about 600 GPs) in southern Norway will be recruited to a cluster randomized trial. Participating groups will be randomized either to an intervention- or a control group. The control group will not receive any intervention towards prescription patterns in elderly, but will be the target of an educational intervention for prescription of antibiotics for respiratory tract infections. A multifaceted intervention has been tailored, where key components are educational outreach visits to the CME-groups, work-shops, audit and feedback. Prescription Peer Academic Detailers (Rx-PADs), who are trained GPs, will conduct the educational outreach visits. During these visits, a set of quality indicators (QIs), i.e. explicit recommendations for safer prescribing for elderly patients, will be presented and discussed. Software will be handed out for installation in participants' practice computers to enable extraction of pre-defined prescription data. These data will subsequently be linked to corresponding data from the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD). Individual feedback reports will be sent all participating GPs during and one year after the intervention. Feedback reports will include QI-scores on individual- and group levels, before and after the intervention. The main outcome of this trial is the change in proportions of inappropriate prescriptions (QIs) for elderly patients > or = 70 years following intervention, compared to baseline levels. Improvement of prescription patterns in medical practice is a challenging task.

Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is frequently associated with hypercholesterolemia and with an increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Statins lower serum cholesterol levels and may thus improve the cardiovascular risk in PBC patients. The aim of our study was to prospectively examine the efficacy of low-dose atorvastatin on cholestasis as well as cardiovascular risk markers such as dyslipidemia and vascular function in patients with PBC. Nineteen patients with early-stage (biopsy proven and AMA positive) PBC and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) above 130mg/dL were included in this single-center study and treated with atorvastatin 10mg per day for one year. Concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL-C, LDL triglycerides, oxLDL, IgG and sVCAM-1 decreased significantly after 48 weeks of atorvastatin treatment. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery as an indicator of vascular function significantly increased, while carotid artery intima-media thickness and vascular wall stiffness did not progress under treatment. No statistical differences in liver enzymes were observed except a transient increase of alkaline phosphatase. Treatment with low-dose atorvastatin is safe in early-stage PBC, effectively reduces total cholesterol, LDL-C, LDL triglycerides, oxLDL and sVCAM-1 and improves vascular function as reflected by FMD, without affecting cholestasis progression. Therefore, statin therapy should be considered in PBC patients with additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

The meal tolerance test and study drug were coadministered at week 0 to assess the direct effect of colesevelam on glucose absorption. Insulin sensitivity as measured by the insulin clamp method did not change, but the Matsuda Index, a measure of whole-body insulin sensitivity calculated from postmeal tolerance test glucose and insulin levels, increased significantly within the colesevelam group from baseline to week 8 with last observation carried forward (P = 0.020). The postprandial area under the curve for glucose decreased with colesevelam versus placebo at weeks 2 and 8 with last observation carried forward (P = 0.012 and P = 0.061, respectively); the area under the curve for insulin did not decrease in concert with the decrease in area under the curve for glucose at week 2 (P = 0.585).

Efficacy and safety data were pooled from 12 studies (n=6151). These were 6- to 96-week randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo- or active-controlled trials with lapaquistat monotherapy or coadministration with other lipid-altering drugs in dyslipidemic patients, including a large (n=2121) 96-week safety study. All studies included lapaquistat 100 mg daily; 5 included 50 mg; and 1 included 25 mg. The main outcome measures were the percent change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, secondary lipid/metabolic parameters, and overall safety. Lapaquistat 100 mg significantly decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 21.6% in monotherapy and by 18.0% in combination with a statin. It also reduced other cardiovascular risk markers, such as C-reactive protein. Total adverse events were higher for lapaquistat than placebo, although individual events were generally similar. At 100 mg, there was an increase in alanine aminotransferase value \u22653 times the upper limit of normal on \u22652 consecutive visits (2.0% versus 0.3% for placebo in the pooled efficacy studies; 2.7% versus 0.7% for low-dose atorvastatin in the long-term study). Two patients receiving lapaquistat 100 mg met the Hy Law criteria of alanine aminotransferase elevation plus increased total bilirubin. Squalene synthase inhibition with lapaquistat acetate, alone or in combination with statins, effectively lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner. Elevations in alanine aminotransferase, combined with a rare increase in bilirubin, presented potential hepatic safety issues, resulting in termination of development. The lapaquistat experience illustrates the current challenges in lipid-altering drug development. URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

The following study was conducted to prove efficacy and tolerability of propiverine compared to placebo. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial with parallel-group design in children aged 5-10 yr was performed. Prior to the 8-wk medical therapy urologic baseline diagnostics, a 3-wk lifestyle advice (urotherapy) was established. After re-evaluation of in- and exclusion criteria and uroflowmetry, only children fulfilling the requested criteria were allocated to a body-weight-adjusted therapy (10 or 15 mg propiverine twice daily or corresponding placebo). Efficacy parameters derived from bladder diary and a micturition volume protocol. Decrease in voiding frequency per day was chosen as primary efficacy parameter; secondary endpoints included voided volume and incontinence episodes. A safety assessment was conducted. Of 171 randomized children, 87 were treated with propiverine and 84 with placebo. The primary efficacy parameter showed a decrease in voiding frequency (-2.0 episodes for propiverine versus -1.2 for placebo; p=0.0007). Superiority could also be demonstrated for voided volume (31.4 vs. 5.1 ml; p<0.0001) and incontinence episodes (-0.5 vs. -0.2 episodes per d; p=0.0005). The trial design did not allow for separate evaluation of the effect of urotherapy prior to medical treatment. Propiverine was well-tolerated in children. Altogether 23% of side-effects were reported for propiverine and 20% for placebo.

Patients with a first unprovoked DVT were evaluated for the presence of RVT after 3 months of VKA administration; those without RVT suspended VKA, while those with RVT continued oral anticoagulation for up to 2 years. Recurrent thrombosis and/or bleeding events were recorded during treatment (RVT group) and 1 year after VKA withdrawal (both groups). Among 409 patients evaluated for unprovoked DVT, 33.2% (136 of 409 patients) did not have RVT and VKA was stopped. The remaining 273 (66.8%) patients with RVT received anticoagulants for an additional 21 months; during this period of treatment, recurrent venous thromboembolism and major bleeding occurred in 4.7% and 1.1% of patients, respectively.

We included 96 children 5 to 12 years of age who were treated for a minimally angulated (\u2264 15\u00b0) greenstick or transverse fracture of the wrist between April 2007 and September 2009 at a tertiary care pediatric hospital. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a prefabricated wrist splint or a short arm cast for four weeks. The primary outcome was physical function at six weeks, measured using the performance version of the Activities Scale for Kids. Additional outcomes included the degree of angulation, range of motion, grip strength and complications. Of the 96 children, 46 received a splint and 50 a cast. The mean Activities Scale for Kids score at six weeks was 92.8 in the splint group and 91.4 in the cast group (difference 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.75 to 4.62). Thus, the null hypothesis that the splint is less effective by at least seven points was rejected.

The use of varenicline tartrate alleviates postquit withdrawal discomfort, but it also seems to reduce the \"reward\" associated with smoking. The current treatment schedule, which commences 1 week before quitting, relies primarily on the first mechanism. We set out to determine whether increasing the prequit medication period renders cigarettes less satisfying and facilitates quitting. One hundred one smokers attending a stop-smoking clinic in London, United Kingdom, were randomly allocated to receive varenicline for 4 weeks before the target quit date (TQD) or to receive placebo for 3 weeks before the TQD, followed by varenicline for 1 week before the TQD. In both groups, standard varenicline treatment was given for 3 months after the TQD. Measures included smoking satisfaction and smoke intake before quitting, urges to smoke and withdrawal discomfort after quitting, and sustained abstinence from the TQD to 3 months. Varenicline preloading reduced prequit enjoyment of smoking (P = .004) and smoke intake (P < .001), with 36.7% of participants reducing their cotinine concentrations by more than 50% (reducers). Varenicline preloading did not affect postquit withdrawal symptoms, but it increased 12-week abstinence rates (47.2% in the varenicline arm vs 20.8% in the placebo arm, P = .005). The effect was particularly strong among the reducers in the varenicline arm (66.7% in reducers vs 22.6% in nonreducers, P = .002). Varenicline preloading was well tolerated. Although several issues remain to be clarified, varenicline preloading can generate a substantial reduction in ad lib smoking and enhance 12-week quit rates.

Subjects were randomised into a 4-month training program (2 classes/week plus home exercises) of either stretching (control, n=14) or respiratory exercises (yoga, n=15). Yoga respiratory exercises (Bhastrika) consisted of rapid forced expirations followed by inspiration through the right nostril, inspiratory apnoea with generation of intrathoracic negative pressure, and expiration through the left nostril. Pulmonary function, maximum expiratory and inspiratory pressures (PE(max) and PI(max), respectively), heart rate variability and blood pressure variability for spontaneous baroreflex determination were determined at baseline and after 4 months.

The purpose of this pilot study was to determine whether mixing a multinutrient fortifier to approximately one half of the human milk fed each day for a finite period after discharge improves the nutrient intake and growth of predominantly human milk-fed low birth weight infants. We also assessed the impact of this intervention on the exclusivity of human milk feeding. Human milk-fed (> or = 80% feeding per day) low birth weight (750-1800 g) infants (n = 39) were randomly assigned at hospital discharge to either a control or an intervention group. Infants in the control group were discharged from the hospital on unfortified human milk. Nutrient enrichment of human milk in the intervention group was achieved by mixing approximately one half of the human milk provided each day with a powdered multinutrient human milk fortifier for 12 weeks after discharge. Milk with added nutrients was estimated to contain approximately 80 kcal (336 kJ) and 2.2 g protein/100 mL plus other nutrients. Intensive lactation support was provided to both groups. Infants in the intervention group were longer during the study period, and those born < or = 1250 g had larger head circumferences than infants in the control group. There was a trend toward infants in the intervention group to be heavier at the end of the intervention compared with those in the control group. Mean protein, zinc, calcium, phosphorus, and vitamins A and D intakes were higher in the intervention group. Results from this study suggest that adding a multinutrient fortifier to approximately one half of the milk provided to predominantly human milk-fed infants for 12 weeks after hospital discharge may be an effective strategy in addressing early discharge nutrient deficits and poor growth without unduly influencing human milk feeding when intensive lactation support is provided.

Vascular calcification (VC) is a major contributor to increased cardiovascular (CV) disease in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and an independent predictor of mortality. VC is inversely correlated with bone mineral density (BMD). Screening for VC may be useful to determine those at greater CV risk and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) may have a dual role in providing VC measurement as well as BMD. We report cross-sectional data on 44 patients with CKD stages 3-4 and aim to determine and validate measurement of VC using DXA. Patients had computed tomography (CT) of abdominal aorta and DXA of lateral lumbar spine, to determine both aortic VC and BMD. Semi-quantitative measurement of VC from DXA was determined (blinded) using previously validated 8- and 24-point scales, and compared with VC from CT. BMD determination from L2 to L4 vertebrae on CT was compared with DXA-reported BMD. Patients 66% male, 57% diabetic, had mean age 63.4 years and mean estimated glomerular filtration rate 31.4 +/- 12 mL/min. Aortic VC was present in 95% on CT, mean 564.9 +/- 304 Hounsfield units (HU). Aortic VC was seen in 68% on lateral DXA, mean scores 5.1 +/- 5.9 and 1.9 +/- 1.9 using 24- and 8-point scales, respectively.

Inhibitors of the JAK family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases have demonstrated clinical efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory disorders; however, the precise mechanisms by which JAK inhibition improves inflammatory immune responses remain unclear. In this study, we examined the mode of action of tofacitinib (CP-690,550) on JAK/STAT signaling pathways involved in adaptive and innate immune responses. To determine the extent of inhibition of specific JAK/STAT-dependent pathways, we analyzed cytokine stimulation of mouse and human T cells in vitro. We also investigated the consequences of CP-690,550 treatment on Th cell differentiation of naive murine CD4(+) T cells. CP-690,550 inhibited IL-4-dependent Th2 cell differentiation and interestingly also interfered with Th17 cell differentiation. Expression of IL-23 receptor and the Th17 cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22 were blocked when naive Th cells were stimulated with IL-6 and IL-23. In contrast, IL-17A production was enhanced when Th17 cells were differentiated in the presence of TGF-\u03b2. Moreover, CP-690,550 also prevented the activation of STAT1, induction of T-bet, and subsequent generation of Th1 cells. In a model of established arthritis, CP-690,550 rapidly improved disease by inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators and suppressing STAT1-dependent genes in joint tissue. Furthermore, efficacy in this disease model correlated with the inhibition of both JAK1 and JAK3 signaling pathways. CP-690,550 also modulated innate responses to LPS in vivo through a mechanism likely involving the inhibition of STAT1 signaling. Thus, CP-690,550 may improve autoimmune diseases and prevent transplant rejection by suppressing the differentiation of pathogenic Th1 and Th17 cells as well as innate immune cell signaling.

Significant improvements in physical function, functional capacity, QOL, and fatigue were observed in the aerobics group. Anaerobic function, tender point count, pain, and symptom severity improved similarly in both groups. It is feasible to conduct an exercise intervention trial in children with FM. Children with FM tolerate moderate-intensity exercise without exacerbation of their disease. Significant improvements in physical function, FM symptoms, QOL, and pain were demonstrated in both exercise groups; the aerobics group performed better in several measures compared with the qigong group. Future studies may need larger sample sizes to confirm clinical improvement and to detect differences in fitness in childhood FM.

The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has anticolorectal cancer activity in vitro and in preclinical models. The present study tested whether a novel, enteric-coated formulation of EPA, as the free fatty acid (EPA-FFA), has chemopreventative efficacy in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients undergoing endoscopic surveillance of their retained rectum postcolectomy were randomised to EPA-FFA (SLA Pharma) 2 g daily or placebo for 6 months. The number and size of polyps in an area of mucosa defined by a tattoo were determined before and after intervention. Global rectal polyp burden was scored (-1, 0, +1) by examination of video endoscopy records. Mucosal fatty acid content was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 55 patients with FAP were evaluated by an intention-to-treat analysis (EPA-FFA 28, placebo 27). Treatment with EPA-FFA for 6 months was associated with a mean 22.4% (95% CI 5.1% to 39.6%) reduction in polyp number (p=0.012) and a 29.8% (3.6% to 56.1%) decrease in the sum of polyp diameters (p=0.027). Global polyp burden worsened over 6 months in the placebo group (-0.34) unlike the EPA-FFA group (+0.09, difference 0.42 (0.10-0.75), p=0.011). EPA-FFA treatment led to a mean 2.6-fold increase in mucosal EPA levels (p=0.018 compared with placebo). EPA-FFA was well tolerated with an incidence of adverse events similar to placebo. EPA-FFA has chemopreventative efficacy in FAP, to a degree similar to that previously observed with selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors.

Patients who successfully titrated (n = 83) entered a double-blind phase; 10 episodes of BTCP were treated with the effective dose (7) or placebo (3). Pain intensity (11-point scale) and pain relief (5-point scale) were assessed between 5 and 60 minutes. Use of rescue medications was recorded, and acceptability assessments were conducted 30 and 60 minutes post dose. Only 6% of patients failed to titrate to an effective dose of FPNS due to lack of efficacy and 5% due to adverse events. A total of 91% of randomized patients completed the study. Episode analysis (FPNS, n = 459; placebo, n = 200) revealed that compared with placebo, 33% of FPNS episodes showed an onset of improvement in pain intensity at 5 minutes (P < 0.05); 33% of episodes by 10 minutes had clinically meaningful pain relief (> or = 2 point decrease in pain intensity; P < 0.0001).

Respiratory mechanical abnormalities in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may impair cardiodynamic responses and convective oxygen delivery during exercise, resulting in slower ventilatory, pulmonary gas exchange (PGE), and heart rate (HR) kinetics compared with normal. We reasoned that bronchodilators and the attendant reduction of operating lung volumes should accelerate ventilatory, PGE, and HR kinetics in the transition from rest to high-intensity exercise. Twelve clinically stable COPD patients undertook constant-work rate cycle testing at 75% of each individual's maximum work capacity after receiving either combined nebulized bronchodilators (BD) or placebo (PL), randomly. Mean response time (MRT) and amplitude of slow component for oxygen uptake (V'O(2)), carbon dioxide production (V'CO(2)), ventilation (V'(E)), and HR together with operating dynamic end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) were measured. Resting and exercise EELV decreased significantly by 0.38 L after BD compared with PL. After BD, V'O(2), V'CO(2), V'(E), and HR MRT accelerated (p < 0.05) by an average of 12, 22, 27, and 22 s, respectively (i.e., 15, 18, 22 and 27%, respectively).

A serious infection (pneumonia) was observed in 1 patient (3%) in the rituximab group after 14.4 patient-years of exposure (6.95 events per 100 patient-years, 95% confidence interval 0.98-49.35), compared with none in the placebo group at week 24. Infections were reported in 18 patients (55%) and 11 patients (61%) in the rituximab and placebo groups, respectively. Grade 3 infections were reported in 3 patients (9%) receiving rituximab and in none of the patients receiving placebo. No grade 4 infections were observed, nor were there any opportunistic, fungal, or tuberculosis infections. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 2 rituximab-treated patients (pneumonia and coronary artery occlusion), whereas there were no SAEs reported in placebo-treated patients. At week 24, the percentage of patients achieving an American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) improvement response was 30% in the rituximab group compared with 17% in the placebo group, and ACR50 responses were achieved by 12% and 6% of patients, respectively. The preliminary safety profile of rituximab in combination with a TNF inhibitor and MTX was consistent with the safety profile of rituximab in combination with MTX in other RA trials without a TNF inhibitor, with no new safety signals observed. SAEs were numerically more frequent in the rituximab group, and there was no clear evidence of an efficacy advantage in patients receiving rituximab in combination with a TNF inhibitor and MTX.

This was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients diagnosed with GAD who had a historical and current lack of response to pharmacotherapy [Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) of \u2265 22 at screening] were randomized to adjunctive treatment with either pregabalin (150-600 mg/day) or placebo. The primary outcome measure was the change in HAM-A total scores after 8 weeks of combination treatment. Adverse events were regularly monitored. Randomized patients (N=356) were treated with pregabalin (n=180) or placebo (n=176). Mean baseline HAM-A scores were 20.7 and 21.4, respectively. After treatment, the mean change in HAM-A was significantly greater for pregabalin compared with placebo (-7.6 vs. -6.4, respectively; P<0.05). HAM-A responder rates (\u2265 50% reduction) were significantly higher for pregabalin (47.5%) versus placebo (35.2%; P=0.0145).

No differences in endometrial histology, embryo quality and pregnancy rates in recipient cycles were observed between the regimens. In conclusion, early administration of GnRH antagonist altered the endocrine profile without modifying the follicular synchrony for the majority of subjects.

Lack of a quantitative tool to assess niacin-induced flushing has precluded the objective evaluation of flushing associated with extended-release (ER) niacin formulations. We developed the Flushing Symptom Questionnaire((c)) (FSQ), a quantitative tool to assess patient-reported flushing, and assessed its ability to characterise ER niacin-induced flushing. This study focused on the responses to one question in the FSQ, the Global Flushing Severity Score (GFSS), reported on a 0-10 scale (none = 0, mild = 1-3, moderate = 4-6, severe = 7-9 and extreme = 10) to assess flushing during ER niacin initiation (week 1) and maintenance (weeks 2-8).

The objectives were to measure and characterize antibody formation to liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, to investigate the impact on glycemic control and safety, and to compare it with exenatide, an agent in the same class. Antibody data were collected during six Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes (LEAD) trials (26-104 wk duration). Samples for determination of antibody formation were collected at LEAD trial sites and analyzed at central laboratories. Antibodies were measured in LEAD trial participants with type 2 diabetes. Interventions included once-daily liraglutide (1.2 or 1.8 mg) or twice-daily exenatide (10 \u03bcg). The main outcome measures included the proportion of patients positive for anti-liraglutide or anti-exenatide antibodies, a glucagon-like peptide-1 cross-reacting effect, and an in vitro liraglutide- or exenatide-neutralizing effect.

Viusid is a nutritional supplement with recognised antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties which could have beneficial effects on cirrhosis-related clinical outcomes such as survival, disease progression and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of viusid in patients with HCV-related decompensated cirrhosis. A randomised double-blind and placebo-controlled study was conducted in a tertiary care academic centre (National Institute of Gastroenterology, Havana, Cuba). The authors randomly assigned 100 patients with HCV-related decompensated cirrhosis to receive viusid (three oral sachets daily, n=50) or placebo (n=50) during 96 weeks. The primary outcome of the study was overall survival at 96 weeks, and the secondary outcomes included time to disease progression, time to HCC diagnosis, time to worsening of the prognostic scoring systems Child-Pugh and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, and time to a new occurrence or relapse for each one of the main clinical complications secondary to portal hypertension at 96 weeks. Viusid led to a significant improvement in overall survival (90%) versus placebo (74%) (HR 0.27, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.92; p=0.036). A similar improvement in disease progression was seen in viusid-treated patients (28%), compared with placebo-treated patients (48%) (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.89; p=0.044). However, the beneficial effects of viusid were wholly observed among patients with Child-Pugh classes B or C, but not among patients with Child-Pugh class A. The cumulative incidence of HCC was significantly reduced in patients treated with viusid (2%) as compared with placebo (12%) (HR 0.15, 95% CI 0.019 to 0.90; p=0.046). Viusid was well tolerated. The results indicate that treatment with viusid leads to a notable improvement in overall clinical outcomes such as survival, disease progression and development of HCC in patients with HCV-related decompensated cirrhosis.

Epidermal keratinocytes in psoriatic lesions are characterized by activated Stat3, and increased levels of cytokines and growth factors that promote Stat3 activation have been found within psoriatic lesions. K5.Stat3C transgenic mice, in which keratinocytes express a constitutively active Stat3, develop psoriasis-like skin lesions. In this study, we examined whether STA-21, a small Stat3 inhibitor, could be useful in ameliorating the skin lesions not only in the model mouse but also in human psoriasis. Treatment with STA-21 markedly inhibited the cytokine-dependent nuclear translocation of Stat3 in normal human keratinocytes in vitro. Keratinocyte proliferation was inhibited by STA-21 in a dose-dependent manner through downregulation of c-Myc and cyclin D1, whereas involucrin, transglutaminase 1, and keratin 10 levels were upregulated. Topical application of STA-21 abolished the generation of skin lesions in K5.Stat3C mice. Finally, we treated psoriasis patients with STA-21-containing ointment in a nonrandomized study. Psoriatic lesions in six of the eight patients showed improvement after topical STA-21 treatment for 2 weeks. Therefore, we conclude that targeting Stat3 may lead to a therapy for psoriasis.

A multicenter, randomized, double-blind controlled study was conducted to compare HD vaccine (which contains 60 microg of hemagglutinin per strain) with the licensed standard-dose (SD) vaccine (which contains 15 microg of hemagglutinin per strain) in adults > or = 65 years of age. HD vaccine was administered to 2575 subjects, and SD vaccine was administered to 1262 subjects.

Mean postvaccination titers for individuals who received HD vaccine were 116 for H1N1, 609 for H3N2, and 69 for B strain; for those who received SD vaccine, mean postvaccination titers were as 67 for H1N1, 333 for H3N2, and 52 for B strain. The HD vaccine met superiority criteria for both A strains, and the responses for B strain met non-inferiority criteria. Seroprotection rates were also higher for those who received HD vaccine than for those who received SD vaccine vaccine, for all strains. Local reactions were more frequent in individuals who received HD vaccine, but the reactions were mild to moderate. There was a statistically significant increase in the level of antibody response induced by HD influenza vaccine, compared with that induced by SD vaccine, without an attendant increase in the rate or severity of clinically relevant adverse reactions.

The effectiveness of the closed-loop system to maintain BIS close to a target of 45 was determined and compared with manual administration. After Institutional Review Board approval and written consent, 40 patients undergoing major surgery in a tertiary university hospital were allocated to two groups using computer-generated block randomization. In the Closed-loop group (n = 20), closed-loop control was used to maintain anesthesia at a target BIS of 45, and in the Control group (n = 20), propofol was administered manually to maintain the same BIS target. To evaluate each technique's performance in maintaining a steady level of hypnosis, the BIS values obtained during the surgical procedure were stratified into four clinical performance categories relative to the target BIS: < or = 10%, 11-20%, 21-30%, or > 30% defined as excellent, good, poor, or inadequate control of hypnosis, respectively.

Baseline demographic, clinical and angiographic characteristics were similar. At 18.3 +/- 7 months of follow-up, the initial strategy of OR plus BMS resulted in significant cost saving when compared to DES (p=0.0001). TLR rate was 8.2% with DES and 7.0% with OR plus BMS (p=0.84), similarly no differences in TVR rate in both groups was seen (10.6% and 10.5% in OR and DES group respectively, p=0.86). Non-inferiority testing, determined that DES therapy failed to be cost saving compared to OR in all possible cost scenarios. A strategy of OR plus BMS is cost saving compared to DES in patients undergoing PCI for de novo coronary lesions.

Coadministration of statin and fenofibrate monotherapies is frequently used to treat patients with dyslipidemia; however, a fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet is not currently marketed. This study evaluates a new FDC tablet of atorvastatin 40 mg and fenofibrate 100 mg. This was a 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group Phase IIb study. Adults with dyslipidemia (non-HDL-C >130 mg/dL and triglycerides [TG] > or =150 but < or =500 mg/dL) were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive the FDC, atorvastatin 40 mg, or fenofibrate 145 mg for 12 weeks. Study medication was taken once daily in the evening, without regard to meals. Patients attended follow-up visits after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of the double-blind treatment. The primary efficacy end points were the mean percentage changes from baseline to the final visit (week 12) in non-HDL-C, HDL-C, and TG. Secondary variables were LDL-C, VLDL-C particle concentration, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein (a), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, homocysteine, creatinine, myeloperoxidase, and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2. Tolerability was assessed by adverse events, laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical examinations, and ECGs. Patients (n = 220) were aged 26 to 87 years; 115 (52.3%) were men and 105 (47.7%) were women; 189 (85.9%) were white, 17 (7.7%) were black, and 15 (6.8%) were Hispanic or Latino; and mean (SD) weight was 200.5 (40.85) lb (range, 103.5-367.4 lb). Previous treatments were statins (25.9% [57/220]), fibrates (1.8% [4/220]), and dietary supplements (25.5% [56/220]); 57.7% (127/220) of patients were treatment naive. Use of the FDC was associated with an improvement in non-HDL-C (-44.8%) that was significantly greater than with fenofibrate monotherapy (-16.1%; P < 0.001) but was not significantly different from that with atorvastatin monotherapy (-40.2%; P = NS). HDL-C increased significantly more in the FDC group (19.7%) than with atorvastatin (6.5%; P < 0.001) but was not significantly different from fenofibrate (18.2%; P = NS). TG lowering in the FDC group (-49.1%) was significantly greater than with both atorvastatin (-28.9%; P < 0.001) and fenofibrate (-27.8%; P = 0.001). LDL-C lowering in the FDC group (-42.3%) was significantly greater than with fenofibrate (-13.9%; P < 0.001) but not significantly different from atorvastatin (-43.1%; P = NS). The FDC had either comparable or significantly greater improvements in other lipid variables and multiple secondary variables. The FDC was generally well tolerated; the tolerability profile was consistent with those of atorvastatin and fenofibrate monotherapies. Treatment-emergent adverse events (ie, those occurring after the first dose of study medication) were recorded in 43 of 73 patients (58.9%) for the FDC, 49 of 74 (66.2%) for atorvastatin, and 48 of 73 (65.8%) for fenofibrate. In this 12-week study, patients with dyslipidemia treated with the 40/100-mg atorvastatin/ fenofibrate FDC had a significantly greater reduction in TG than those treated with atorvastatin 40 mg or higher-dose fenofibrate 145 mg. Treatment with the FDC was also associated with a significantly greater reduction in non-HDL-C compared with fenofibrate alone and a greater increase in HDL-C compared with atorvastatin alone. All treatments were generally well tolerated.

Our objective was to investigate if GH treatment prevents LBM loss in the early postoperative period. This was an open, prospective, randomized, and controlled study. A total of 24 women (body mass index: 44.4 +/- 7.6 kg/m(2), aged 36.8 +/- 11.7 yr) undergoing laparoscopic-adjustable silicone gastric banding (LASGB) and with GH deficiency after LASGB was included in the study. Group A (n = 12) included a standardized diet regimen and exercise program plus recombinant human GH (0.5 +/- 0.13 mg every day), and group B (n = 12) included a standardized diet regimen and exercise program. The follow-up duration was 6 months. The excess of body weight loss did not differ between groups A and B after 3 and 6 months. At 3 months, LBM loss was lower (P < 0.0001) and fat mass (FM) loss was higher (P = 0.02) in group A than group B.

A subset included 248 subjects who were treated with patching or Bangerter filters and had stereoacuity testing at both the baseline and outcome examinations. Multivariate regression models identified factors associated with baseline stereoacuity and with outcome stereoacuity as measured by the Randot Preschool Stereoacuity test. Better baseline stereoacuity was associated with better baseline amblyopic eye acuity (P < 0.001), less anisometropia (P = 0.03), and anisometropia due to astigmatism alone (P < 0.001). Better outcome stereoacuity was associated with better baseline stereoacuity (P < 0.001) and better amblyopic eye acuity at outcome (P < 0.001). Among 48 subjects whose amblyopic eye visual acuity at outcome was 20/25 or better and within one line of the fellow eye, stereoacuity was worse than that of children with normal vision of the same age. In children with anisometropic amblyopia of 20/40 to 20/100 inclusive, better posttreatment stereoacuity is associated with better baseline stereoacuity and better posttreatment amblyopic eye acuity.

We aimed to assess whether paricalcitol could be used to reduce albuminuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy. In this multinational, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, we enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria who were receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Patients were assigned (1:1:1) by computer-generated randomisation sequence to receive 24 weeks\u2019 treatment with placebo,1 \u03bcg/day paricalcitol, or 2 \u03bcg/day paricalcitol. The primary endpoint was the percentage change in geometric mean urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) from baseline to last measurement during treatment for the combined paricalcitol groups versus the placebo group. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00421733.

Previous studies also used selective cox-2 inhibitors as single postoperative dose, in continued mode, or in combination with other modalities. The purpose of this study was to compare analgesic efficacy of single preoperative administration of etoricoxib versus celecoxib for post-operative pain relief after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. One hundred and two patients diagnosed as anterior cruciate ligament injury were randomized into 3 groups using opaque envelope. Both patients and surgeon were blinded to the allocation. All of the patients were operated by one orthopaedic surgeon under regional anesthesia. Each group was given either etoricoxib 120 mg., celecoxib 400 mg., or placebo 1 hour prior to operative incision. Post-operative pain intensity, time to first dose of analgesic requirement and numbers of analgesic used for pain control and adverse events were recorded periodically to 48 hours after surgery. We analyzed the data according to intention to treat principle. Among 102 patients, 35 were in etoricoxib, 35 in celecoxib and 32 in placebo group. The mean age of the patients was 30 years and most of the injury came from sports injury. There were no significant differences in all demographic characteristics among groups. The etoricoxib group had significantly less pain intensity than the other two groups at recovery room and up to 8 hours period but no significance difference in all other evaluation point, while celecoxib showed no significantly difference from placebo at any time points. The time to first dose of analgesic medication, amount of analgesic used, patient's satisfaction with pain control and incidence of adverse events were also no significantly difference among three groups.

Hierarchical analysis testing for superiority over placebo was followed by noninferiority analysis and then superiority testing of azilsartan medoxomil (80 mg and then 40 mg) versus the comparator ARBs. For 1291 randomized patients, mean age was 56 years, 54% were men, and baseline 24-hour mean systolic BP was 145 mm Hg.

Increases were also observed in stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha, IP-10, cutaneous T-cell-attracting chemokine, monokine induced by IFN-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, and IFN-alpha. Posttreatment changes in plasma sVEGFR2 and interleukin (IL)-4 significantly correlated with tumor shrinkage. Baseline levels of 11 CAFs significantly correlated with tumor shrinkage, with IL-12 showing the strongest association. Using multivariate classification, a baseline CAF signature consisting of hepatocyte growth factor and IL-12 was associated with tumor response to pazopanib and identified responding patients with 81% accuracy. These data suggest that CAF profiling may be useful for identifying patients likely to benefit from pazopanib, and merit further investigation in clinical trials.

In addition to its efficacy in reducing LDL-cholesterol, rosuvastatin has been shown to significantly decrease plasma triacylglycerol. The use of rosuvastatin may be beneficial in patients with type 2 diabetes, who usually have increased triacylglycerol levels. However, its effects on the metabolism of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins in type 2 diabetic patients remains unknown. We performed a randomised double-blind crossover trial of 6-week treatment with placebo or rosuvastatin 20 mg in eight patients with type 2 diabetes who were being treated with oral glucose-lowering agents. In each patient, an in vivo kinetic study of apolipoprotein B (ApoB)-containing lipoproteins with [13C]leucine was performed at the end of each treatment period. A central randomisation centre used computer-generated tables to allocate treatments. Participants, caregivers and those assessing the outcomes were blinded to group assignment. Rosuvastatin 20 mg significantly reduced plasma LDL-cholesterol, triacylglycerol and total ApoB. It also significantly reduced ApoB pool sizes of larger triacylglycerol-rich VLDL particles (VLDL1; p = 0.011), smaller VLDL particles (VLDL2; p = 0.011), intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL; p = 0.011) and LDL (p = 0.011). This reduction was associated with a significant increase in the total fractional catabolic rate of VLDL1-ApoB (6.70 +/- 3.24 vs 4.52 +/- 2.34 pool/day, p = 0.049), VLDL2-ApoB (8.72 +/- 3.37 vs 5.36 +/- 2.64, p = 0.011), IDL-ApoB (7.06 +/- 1.68 vs 4.21 +/- 1.51, p = 0.011) and LDL-ApoB (1.02 +/- 0.27 vs 0.59 +/- 0.13, p = 0.011). Rosuvastatin did not change the production rates of VLDL2-, IDL- or LDL-, but did reduce VLDL1-ApoB production rate (12.4 +/- 4.5 vs 19.5 +/- 8.4 mg kg(-1) day(-1), p = 0.035). No side effects of rosuvastatin were observed during the study. In type 2 diabetic patients rosuvastatin 20 mg not only induces a significant increase of LDL-ApoB catabolism (73%), but also has favourable effects on the catabolism of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins, e.g. a significant increase in the catabolism of VLDL1-ApoB (48%), VLDL2-ApoB (63%) and IDL-ApoB (68%), and a reduction in the production rate of VLDL1-ApoB (-36%). The effects of rosuvastatin on the metabolism of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins may be beneficial for prevention of atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetic patients.

Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between EAITQ and EWITQ scores, patient characteristics and patient-reported outcomes measures. Wilcoxon Signed Rank test compared EAITQ and EWITQ item score distributions. Differences between EAITQ and EWITQ scores were calculated to categorize patients according to the extent to which their expectations were met by experiences (i.e. unmet, met, exceeded). EAITQ and EWITQ data were available for 240 patients (61% male, mean age 58 years, mean diabetes duration 10 years, mean baseline HbA(1c) 8.4%). Increasingly positive expectations were significantly associated with greater self-efficacy; greater levels of positive experiences were significantly associated with greater positive expectations, shorter diabetes duration, less symptom distress, greater well-being, self-efficacy and diabetes treatment satisfaction. Overall, patients' experiences with inhaled insulin therapy were significantly more positive than their expectations: 58% patients' experiences exceeded expectations, 29% patients' experiences met expectations and 13% patients' experiences did not meet expectations. Post hoc tests indicated that treatment satisfaction scores differed among these groups (all p < 0.01). Expectations may not independently impact treatment satisfaction, but the relationship with experiences significantly contributes to it. The EAITQ and EWITQ may be useful tools for clinicians to better understand patients' expectations about and experiences with insulin therapy.

We did a double-blind, placebo-controlled 20-week trial, with open-label orlistat comparator in 19 sites in Europe. 564 individuals (18-65 years of age, body-mass index 30-40 kg/m2) were randomly assigned, with a telephone or web-based system, to one of four liraglutide doses (1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, 2.4 mg, or 3.0 mg, n=90-95) or to placebo (n=98) administered once a day subcutaneously, or orlistat (120 mg, n=95) three times a day orally. All individuals had a 500 kcal per day energy-deficit diet and increased their physical activity throughout the trial, including the 2-week run-in. Weight change analysed by intention to treat was the primary endpoint. An 84-week open-label extension followed. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00422058. Participants on liraglutide lost significantly more weight than did those on placebo (p=0.003 for liraglutide 1.2 mg and p<0.0001 for liraglutide 1.8-3.0 mg) and orlistat (p=0.003 for liraglutide 2.4 mg and p<0.0001 for liraglutide 3.0 mg). Mean weight loss with liraglutide 1.2-3.0 mg was 4.8 kg, 5.5 kg, 6.3 kg, and 7.2 kg compared with 2.8 kg with placebo and 4.1 kg with orlistat, and was 2.1 kg (95% CI 0.6-3.6) to 4.4 kg (2.9-6.0) greater than that with placebo. More individuals (76%, n=70) lost more than 5% weight with liraglutide 3.0 mg that with placebo (30%, n=29) or orlistat (44%, n=42). Liraglutide reduced blood pressure at all doses, and reduced the prevalence of prediabetes (84-96% reduction) with 1.8-3.0 mg per day. Nausea and vomiting occurred more often in individuals on liraglutide than in those on placebo, but adverse events were mainly transient and rarely led to discontinuation of treatment.

This study evaluated the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of TIV in HIV-infected adults. In Johannesburg, South Africa, we undertook a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 506 HIV-infected adults. Subjects included 157 individuals who were antiretroviral treatment (ART) naive and 349 on stable-ART. Participants were randomly assigned to receive TIV or normal saline intramuscularly. Oropharyngeal swabs were obtained at illness visits during the influenza season and tested by shell vial culture and RT PCR assay for influenza virus. Immune response was evaluated by hemagglutinin antibody inhibition assay (HAI) in a nested cohort. The primary study outcome involved vaccine efficacy against influenza confirmed illness. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00757900. The efficacy of TIV against confirmed influenza illness was 75.5% (95% CI: 9.2%-95.6%); with a risk difference of 0.18 per 100 person-weeks in TIV recipients. Among TIV recipients, seroconversion, measured by HAI titers, was evident in 52.6% for H1N1, 60.8% for H3N2, and 53.6% for influenza B virus. This compared with 2.2%, 2.2%, and 4.4% of placebo recipients (P < .0001). The frequency of local and systemic adverse events post-immunization was similar between study groups.

By intent-to-treat, missing = failure analysis, no differences in virological efficacy were observed at any time point (week 48 <50 copies/mL continue 85%, switch 88%). At week 24, switching was associated with significant increases in hemoglobin (mean difference 0.37 g/dL, 95% confidence interval: 0.15 to 0.58 g/dL, P < 0.001) and significant declines in total cholesterol and triglycerides. In the dual x-ray absorptiometry substudy (n = 100), fat was preserved or increased in the switch group but declined in the continue group (mean difference 448 g, 95% confidence interval: 57 to 839 g, P = 0.025). Individuals with longer exposure to zidovudine and lower baseline limb fat experienced less limb fat increase after switching. No differences in renal adverse events were observed between groups. Switching from zidovudine/lamivudine to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine in persons on efavirenz therapy maintains virological control, establishes a once-daily regimen, results in improvements in hemoglobin and key lipid parameters, and preserves and restores limb fat relative to continuation of zidovudine/lamivudine.

Giant-cell tumour (GCT) of bone is a primary osteolytic bone tumour with low metastatic potential and is associated with substantial skeletal morbidity. GCT is rich in osteoclast-like giant cells and contains mononuclear (stromal) cells that express RANK ligand (RANKL), a key mediator of osteoclast activation. We investigated the potential therapeutic effect of denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against RANKL, on tumour-cell survival and growth in patients with GCT. In this open-label, single-group study, 37 patients with recurrent or unresectable GCT were enrolled and received subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg monthly (every 28 days), with loading doses on days 8 and 15 of month 1. The primary endpoint was tumour response, defined as elimination of at least 90% of giant cells or no radiological progression of the target lesion up to week 25. Study recruitment is closed; patient treatment and follow-up are ongoing. The study is registered with Clinical Trials.gov, NCT00396279. Two patients had insufficient histology or radiology data for efficacy assessment. 30 of 35 (86%; 95% CI 70-95) of evaluable patients had a tumour response: 20 of 20 assessed by histology and 10 of 15 assessed by radiology. Adverse events were reported in 33 of 37 patients; the most common being pain in an extremity (n=7), back pain (n=4), and headache (n=4). Five patients had grade 3-5 adverse events, only one of which (grade 3 increase in human chorionic gonadotropin concentration not related to pregnancy) was deemed to be possibly treatment related.

Dyslipidemia increases the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and is incompletely reversed by statin therapy alone in many patients. Thyroid hormone lowers levels of serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and has other potentially favorable actions on lipoprotein metabolism. Consequently, thyromimetic drugs hold promise as lipid-lowering agents if adverse effects can be avoided. We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the thyromimetic compound eprotirome (KB2115) in lowering the level of serum LDL cholesterol in patients with hypercholesterolemia who were already receiving simvastatin or atorvastatin. In addition to statin treatment, patients received either eprotirome (at a dose of 25, 50, or 100 microg per day) or placebo. Secondary outcomes were changes in levels of serum apolipoprotein B, triglycerides, and Lp(a) lipoprotein. Patients were monitored for potential adverse thyromimetic effects on the heart, bone, and pituitary. The addition of placebo or eprotirome at a dose of 25, 50, or 100 microg daily to statin treatment for 12 weeks reduced the mean level of serum LDL cholesterol from 141 mg per deciliter (3.6 mmol per liter) to 127, 113, 99, and 94 mg per deciliter (3.3, 2.9, 2.6, and 2.4 mmol per liter), respectively, (mean reduction from baseline, 7%, 22%, 28%, and 32%).

A randomized, controlled trial of 74 adult men who were administered 200 g fructose daily for 2 weeks with or without allopurinol. Primary measures included changes in ambulatory blood pressure (BP), fasting lipids, glucose and insulin, homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) index, body mass index and criteria for metabolic syndrome. The ingestion of fructose resulted in an increase in ambulatory BP (7+/-2 and 5+/-2 mm Hg for systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), P<0.004 and P<0.007, respectively). Mean fasting triglycerides increased by 0.62+/-0.23 mmol l(-1) (55+/-20 mg per 100 ml), whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 0.06+/-0.02 mmol l(-1) (2.5+/-0.7 mg per 100 ml), P<0.002 and P<0.001, respectively. Fasting insulin and HOMA indices increased significantly, whereas plasma glucose level did not change. All liver function tests showed an increase in values. The metabolic syndrome increased by 25-33% depending on the criteria. Allopurinol lowered the serum uric acid level (P<0.0001) and prevented the increase in 24-h ambulatory DBP and daytime SBP and DBP. Allopurinol treatment did not reduce HOMA or fasting plasma triglyceride levels, but lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol relative to control (P<0.02) and also prevented the increase in newly diagnosed metabolic syndrome (0-2%, P=0.009).

Preclinical work has suggested that IL-1 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of a long-acting IL-1 receptor inhibitor, AMG 108, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-dosing study in patients with active RA who were receiving stable methotrexate (15 to 25 mg/week). Patients were randomized equally to receive placebo or 50, 125, or 250 mg AMG 108 subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 6 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was a 20% improvement in the American College of Rheumatology response (ACR20) at week 24; other efficacy endpoints included the ACR50, the ACR70, and the RA disease activity score (28-joint count Disease Activity Score) responses, patient-reported outcomes, and pharmacokinetic parameters. Safety endpoints included treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), infectious AEs, serious AEs, serious infections, injection site reactions, laboratory abnormalities, and antibodies to AMG 108. Of 813 patients enrolled in the study, 204 patients were randomized to the 50 mg group, 203 to the 125 mg group, 203 to the 250 mg group, and 203 to placebo. At week 24, 40.4% of the 250 mg group, 36% of the 125 mg group, 30.9% of the 50 mg group, and 29.1% of the placebo group achieved an ACR20 (P = 0.022, 250 mg vs. placebo). Of the individual ACR components, numerical dose-dependent improvements were only seen in tender joint counts, pain (visual analog scale), and the acute phase reactants, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. No dose-related increase was observed in the incidence of treatment-emergent AEs.

No major changes were observed in activation of CD4(+) T-cells. Conversely, raltegravir intensification significantly reduced activation of CD8(+) T-cells at week 48 (HLA-DR(+)CD38(+), P=0.005), especially in the memory compartment (CD38(+) of CD8(+)CD45RO(+), P<0.0001).

This multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial included patients with a Crohn's disease activity index < or =250 and fistulas between the anus (or low rectum) and perineum, vulva, or vagina, that drained for more than 2 months. Magnetic resonance imaging or endosonography was performed to assess fistula tracts and the absence of abscesses. Patients were stratified into groups with simple or complex fistulas and randomly assigned to receive fibrin glue injections (n = 36) or only observation (n = 41) after removal of setons. The primary end point was clinical remission at week 8, defined as the absence of draining, perianal pain, or abscesses. At week 8, a fibrin glue injection was offered to patients who were not in remission. Clinical remission was observed in 13 of the 34 patients (38%) of the fibrin glue group compared with 6 of the 37 (16%) in the observation group; these findings demonstrate the benefit of fibrin glue (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% confidence interval: 1.1-9.8; P = .04). The benefit seemed to be greater in patients with simple fistulas. Four patients in the fibrin glue group and 6 in the observation group had adverse events. Fibrin glue injection is a simple, effective, and well-tolerated therapeutic option for patients with Crohn's disease and perianal fistula tracts.

Ninety-nine patients were randomly assigned to groups that received pregabalin 150 mg or placebo 1 h before surgery, with the dose repeated after 12 h. Assessments of pain and side effects were performed 48 h postoperatively. The incidences of chronic pain and hypoesthesia in the anterior chest were recorded 3 months after surgery. Ninety-four patients completed the study. Verbal numerical rating scale scores for pain and the need for additional analgesics were lower in the pregabalin group (n = 47) than the placebo group (n = 47) during 48 h postoperatively (P < 0.05). However, incidences of sedation and dizziness were higher in the pregabalin group (P < 0.05). There were no differences between the groups in the incidences of chronic pain and chest hypoesthesia at 3 months after surgery.

Despite the lack of Food and Drug Administration approval and the absence of placebo-controlled trials to demonstrate efficacy, butalbital-containing medications are among the most commonly prescribed acute migraine treatments in the United States. Butalbital-containing medications are associated with serious and undesirable side effects, and have been linked to the chronification of migraine and development of medication-overuse headaches. This study compares the relative efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a fixed dose SumaRT/Nap versus a BCM and placebo. Enrolled subjects were required to have treated at least 1 migraine with a butalbital medication in the past. Enrolled subjects treated 3 moderate to severe migraines using each of the 3 study treatments once in a randomized sequence. The primary endpoint compared SumaRT/Nap versus BCM for sustained pain freedom at 2-24 hours without the use of any rescue medication. This study combines data from 2 identical outpatient, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, 3 attack crossover studies in adult migraineurs (International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edition). A total of 442 subjects treated at least 1 attack with study medication. The majority of the treated subjects were female (88%) with a mean age 43 years, who reported that their migraines had a severe impact on their lives (78% with Headache Impact Test-6 of >59). At screening, 88% of subjects reported current butalbital use; 68% had used butalbital for more than 6 weeks; and 82% reported satisfaction with butalbital. Across treatment groups, 28-29% of subjects took study medication within 15 minutes of migraine onset, 34-37% of subjects took study medication >15 minutes to 2 hours after onset, and 32-36% of subjects took study medication more than 2 hours after onset. This study did not detect a difference at the nominal 0.05 level in percent sustained pain-free between SumaRT/Nap (8%), BCM (6%), and placebo (3%). SumaRT/Nap was superior to BCM for pain free at 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48 hours (P\u2264.044); pain relief (mild or no pain) at 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48 hours (P\u2264.01); sustained pain relief 2-24 hours (P<.001); migraine free (pain free with no nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia) at 4, 6, 8, 24, 48 hours (P\u2264.046); and complete symptom free (migraine free with no neck/sinus pain) at 4, 6, 8, 48 hours (P\u2264.031). Adverse event incidence was similar for all treatments (10%, 12%, and 9% for placebo, SumaRT/Nap, and BCM, respectively). Nausea was the most frequent adverse event (2%, 2%, and <1% for placebo, SumaRT/Nap, and BCM, respectively).

Before the study, these subjects used butalbital-containing medications as part of their current migraine treatment regimen and were satisfied with it, suggesting they were butalbital responders who had found a workable treatment strategy for themselves. When treated with SumaRT/Nap versus BCM in this study, however, a significant proportion of subjects reported better treatment outcomes for themselves for both migraine pain and associated symptoms.

Non-inferiority of rivaroxaban to warfarin was confirmed; the rate of the principal safety outcome was 18.04% per year in rivaroxaban-treated patients and 16.42% per year in warfarin-treated patients (hazard ratio [HR] 1.11; 95% confidence interval 0.87-1.42; P<0.001 [non-inferiority]). Intracranial hemorrhage rates were 0.8% with rivaroxaban and 1.6% with warfarin. There was a strong trend for a reduction in the rate of stroke/systemic embolism with rivaroxaban vs. warfarin (HR, 0.49; P=0.050).

To determine the efficacy and safety of 2 doses of gadobutrol 1.0 M (0.1 and 0.2 mmol/kg body weight [BW]), compared with gadoteridol 0.5 M (0.2 mmol/kg BW), in contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) of brain metastases in patients with known or suspected brain metastases from systemic malignancies. The study also compared the usefulness of gadobutrol in treatment planning for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). This was a Phase II/III, multicenter, single-blind, randomized, controlled, crossover, intraindividual comparison study. Each patient underwent one MRI study examination with gadobutrol and the other with gadoteridol, each at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg BW, administered twice, for a total dose of 0.2 mmol/kg BW. Image acquisition was carried out after the first and second doses of gadobutrol, but only after the second dose of gadoteridol. Contrast agents were assigned in a randomized order and their administration separated by an interval of 1 to 14 days. Images were evaluated through blinded readings by 3 independent experienced radiologists. Treatment planning for SRS was assessed in a blinded manner, as a consensus between a diagnostic neuroradiologist and a radiation oncologist, in addition to the clinical investigator's assessment. The safety and tolerability of gadobutrol and gadoteridol were evaluated in all patients who received the study drugs. The primary efficacy variable was the number of lesions detected in CE-MRI images; the secondary efficacy variables were the degree of contrast enhancement and border delineation of lesions, and experts' confidence in treatment planning for SRS. A total of 175 patients were enrolled and randomized, with 164 (93.7%) included in the safety analysis set, and 151 (86.2%) evaluable in the efficacy analysis. The mean number of detected lesions per patient using the average of the 3 blinded readers was 6.28, 6.92, and 6.87 for gadobutrol 0.1 and 0.2 mmol/kg BW, and gadoteridol 0.2 mmol/kg BW, respectively. Noninferiority of gadobutrol (both doses) to gadoteridol 0.2 mmol/kg BW was demonstrated. The degree of contrast enhancement and the border delineation of each lesion were categorized as \"good\" or \"excellent\" for most lesions for both agents. Almost all enhanced images were rated as \"confident\" in treatment planning for SRS. Sixty-five (43%) and 62 (41%) patients in the gadobutrol 0.1 and 0.2 mmol/kg BW groups, respectively, were selected as eligible for SRS treatment. The percentage of images assessed as \"gadobutrol was better than gadoteridol\" was higher than that assessed as \"gadoteridol was better than gadobutrol\" for both doses of gadobutrol. Eight adverse events were reported as being related to the study drug in 7 patients (4.3%) in each group. In this study, a single dose of gadobutrol was shown to be noninferior to a double dose of gadoteridol at detecting brain metastases, and could be effectively used for treatment planning in patients eligible for SRS. A dose of gadobutrol 0.1 mmol/kg BW is recommended as the clinical dose for the detection of brain metastases.

The primary outcome was treatment success at 12 months, defined as a reduction in the score on the Urogenital Distress Inventory of 70% or more and a response of \"much better\" or \"very much better\" on the Patient Global Impression of Improvement. The predetermined noninferiority margin was 11 percentage points.

The treatment of patients with haematological malignancies by means of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is often accompanied by life threatening infections.

Therefore we evaluated the safety of the promising new antimicrobial peptide human lactoferrrin 1-11 (hLF1-11) in healthy volunteers and patients. We undertook a sequential, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study using ascending single (0.005, 0.05, 0.5, 5 mg) and multiple intravenous doses (0.5, 5 mg) in healthy volunteers, and open-label, single intravenous 5 mg doses in autologous HSCT recipients. Single and multiple doses of hLF1-11 were tolerable up to 5 mg intravenously in healthy volunteers, while 5 mg single dose was tolerable in patients. Elevations in transaminases possibly related to treatment were reversible and not serious. The new antimicrobial hLF1-11 is well tolerated in healthy volunteers with repeated daily doses up to 5 mg. The side-effect profile is very favourable for an antimicrobial, the only undesirable effect being a possible elevation of transaminases, which may be related to hLF1-11 although the current data do not allow conclusive interpretation of treatment relationship.

Subjects had completed one of 4 randomized, double-blind parent studies (XP052/XP053/XP081/XP083). Gabapentin enacarbil 1200 mg was administered once daily at 5 pm; dose adjustments to 600 or 1800 mg were permitted based on investigator judgment. Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and electrocardiograms. Efficacy evaluations included the International Restless Legs Scale total score and the investigator-rated Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale, at week 52 last observation carried forward. The safety population comprised 573 subjects; 386 (67.4%) completed the study. Treatment-emergent AEs were reported by 80.1% of subjects and led to withdrawal in 10.3% of subjects; most (67.7%) were mild or moderate in intensity. The most common AEs were somnolence and dizziness (19.7% and 11.5% of subjects). Twenty subjects (3.5%) reported serious AEs; one subject died (fall, 25 days after stopping gabapentin enacarbil, judged not treatment related). No serious AE occurred in more than 1 subject.

More than half of all antibiotic prescriptions in general practice are issued for respiratory tract infections (RTIs), despite convincing evidence that many of these infections are caused by viruses. Frequent misuse of antimicrobial agents is of great global health concern, as we face an emerging worldwide threat of bacterial antibiotic resistance. There is an increasing need to identify determinants and patterns of antibiotic prescribing, in order to identify where clinical practice can be improved. Approximately 80 peer continuing medical education (CME) groups in southern Norway will be recruited to a cluster randomized trial. Participating groups will be randomized either to an intervention- or a control group. A multifaceted intervention has been tailored, where key components are educational outreach visits to the CME-groups, work-shops, audit and feedback. Prescription Peer Academic Detailers (Rx-PADs), who are trained GPs, will conduct the educational outreach visits. During these visits, evidence-based recommendations of antibiotic prescriptions for RTIs will be presented and software will be handed out for installation in participants PCs, enabling collection of prescription data. These data will subsequently be linked to corresponding data from the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD). Individual feedback reports will be sent all participating GPs during and one year after the intervention. Main outcomes are baseline proportion of inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions for RTIs and change in prescription patterns compared to baseline one year after the initiation of the tailored pedagogic intervention. Improvement of prescription patterns in medical practice is a challenging task. A thorough evaluation of guidelines for antibiotic treatment in RTIs may impose important benefits, whereas inappropriate prescribing entails substantial costs, as well as undesirable consequences like development of antibiotic resistance.

The sample was composed of 15 (7- to 12-year-old) children with 45 active WSL in anterior permanent teeth. The children were randomly divided into two groups providing 22 lesions for G1 and 23 for G2. The children were submitted to weekly varnish applications 4 times. The WSL were evaluated twice: baseline and on week 4. Maximum lesion dimensions (mesiodistal and incisogingival) were measured in millimeters and classified in four grades of size. WSL were also assessed regarding lesion activity by one calibrated examiner. The Pearson chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used (P < 0.01). WSL reductions were observed in both varnish groups (Chi-square = 0.15, d.f. = 1, P = 0.90), and with similar magnitude (in mm): 1.19 and 1.29 for G1 and G2, respectively. Thirty-six WSL (15 in G1 and 21 in G2) were classified as inactive on week 4, reaching an overall value of 80%. No difference was observed between G1 and G2 regarding activity scores (Fisher's exact test, p > 0.01). It was concluded that after 4 applications the two varnish formulations tested produced similar clinical effects, indicating the reduction and the control of carious activity in most WSL.

All patients were prescribed clopidogrel (600 mg) before PCI. After PCI, both groups were treated with atorvastatin (10 mg). The primary end point was 30-day incidence of MACE including death, nonfatal MI, and target vessel revascularization. Secondary end points included corrected thrombolysis in myocardial infarction frame count, myocardial blush grade, and ST-segment resolution at 90 min after PCI.

Agitated delirium is common in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, and is often treated with haloperidol despite concerns about safety and efficacy. Use of conventional sedatives to control agitation can preclude extubation. Dexmedetomidine, a novel sedative and anxiolytic agent, may have particular utility in these patients. We sought to compare the efficacy of haloperidol and dexmedetomidine in facilitating extubation. We conducted a randomised, open-label, parallel-groups pilot trial in the medical and surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital. Twenty patients undergoing mechanical ventilation in whom extubation was not possible solely because of agitated delirium were randomised to receive an infusion of either haloperidol 0.5 to 2 mg/hour or dexmedetomidine 0.2 to 0.7 microg/kg/hr, with or without loading doses of 2.5 mg haloperidol or 1 mug/kg dexmedetomidine, according to clinician preference. Dexmedetomidine significantly shortened median time to extubation from 42.5 (IQR 23.2 to 117.8) to 19.9 (IQR 7.3 to 24) hours (P = 0.016). Dexmedetomidine significantly decreased ICU length of stay, from 6.5 (IQR 4 to 9) to 1.5 (IQR 1 to 3) days (P = 0.004) after study drug commencement. Of patients who required ongoing propofol sedation, the proportion of time propofol was required was halved in those who received dexmedetomidine (79.5% (95% CI 61.8 to 97.2%) vs. 41.2% (95% CI 0 to 88.1%) of the time intubated; P = 0.05). No patients were reintubated; three receiving haloperidol could not be successfully extubated and underwent tracheostomy. One patient prematurely discontinued haloperidol due to QTc interval prolongation. In this preliminary pilot study, we found dexmedetomidine a promising agent for the treatment of ICU-associated delirious agitation, and we suggest this warrants further testing in a definitive double-blind multi-centre trial.

Sirolimus- and paclitaxel-eluting stents implanted in STEMI have been associated with delayed healing and incomplete strut coverage. ZES are associated with a more complete and uniform strut coverage in stable patients, but whether this holds true also after STEMI is unknown. Forty-four patients with STEMI who underwent primary PCI were randomized to ZES or BMS (3:1 randomization). Angiographic, intravascular ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography follow-up was conducted at 6 months and clinical follow-up at 1 year.

As correlative science with a phase II study in patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcomas (STS), we evaluated the impact of this agent on intra-tumor interstitial fluid pressure (IFP), serum circulating biomarkers, and vascular density. Patients with advanced STS with measurable disease and at least one superficial lesion amenable to biopsy received sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. Intratumoral IFP and plasma and circulating cell biomarkers were measured before and after 1-2 months of sorafenib administration. Results were analyzed in the context of the primary clinical endpoint of time-to-progression (TTP). In 15 patients accrued, the median TTP was 45 days (range 14-228). Intra-tumoral IFP measurements obtained in 6 patients at baseline showed a direct correlation with tumor size.

This was a semi-single blind, randomised, multicentre, comparative trial. The primary efficacy end-point was the clinical response 7-14 days posttherapy. One hundred patients were randomised; 48 in each arm were treated. The treatment groups were well balanced with respect to demographics, comorbidities and the type of infection (75% because of MRSA). Overall, clinical success rates were 75.0% (36/48) for daptomycin and 87.5% (42/48) for comparator (95% confidence interval for the difference: -27.9, 2.9). The median duration of comparator therapy was 8 days. Two comparator patients and no daptomycin patients experienced treatment-related serious adverse events requiring hospitalisation.

The aim of this study was to assess the performance of beta-methyl-p-[123I]-iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to detect acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in emergency department patients with chest pain. Emergency department diagnosis of chest pain is problematic, often requiring prolonged observation and stress testing. BMIPP SPECT detects abnormalities in fatty acid metabolism resulting from myocardial ischemia, even many hours after symptom cessation. Emergency department patients with suspected ACS were enrolled at 50 centers. Patients received 5 mCi BMIPP within 30 h of symptom cessation. BMIPP SPECT images were interpreted semiquantitatively by 3 blinded readers. Initial clinical diagnosis was based on symptoms, initial electrocardiograms, and troponin, whereas the final diagnosis was based on all available data (including angiography and stress SPECT) but not BMIPP SPECT. Final diagnoses were adjudicated by a blinded committee as ACS, intermediate likelihood of ACS, or negative for ACS. A total of 507 patients were studied and efficacy was evaluated in 448 patients with sufficient data. The sensitivity of BMIPP by 3 blinded readers for a final diagnosis of ACS and intermediate likelihood of ACS was 71% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 64% to 79%), 74% (95% CI: 68% to 81%), and 69% (95% CI: 62% to 77%); the corresponding specificity of BMIPP was 67% (95% CI: 61% to 73%), 54% (95% CI: 48% to 60%), and 70% (95% CI: 64% to 76%).

Topical calcipotriene is frequently prescribed for the treatment of plaque-type psoriasis. Calcipotriene is currently available in the US as an ointment, a solution, a cream, and in a fixed-dose combination ointment with betamethasone dipropionate. Calcipotriene 0.005% has recently been formulated as a foam using a novel aqueous-based formulation to provide a new topical treatment option for patients with psoriasis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical calcipotriene 0.005% foam for the treatment of mild to moderate plaque-type psoriasis. Two identical, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, 8-week phase III clinical trials. Subjects with plaque-type psoriasis affecting 2-20% of the body surface area, with an identifiable target lesion affecting the trunk or extremities, were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to calcipotriene foam (n = 437) or vehicle foam (n = 222). Study medication was applied twice daily for 8 weeks. Treatment success was defined as a score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear) on the Investigator's Static Global Assessment (ISGA) psoriasis rating scale and a minimum improvement of ISGA score of at least 2 grades from baseline. Predefined target lesions were assessed for erythema, scaling, and plaque thickness. Primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects in each treatment group who achieved treatment success after 8 weeks, analyzed on an intent-to-treat (ITT) basis. In the primary endpoint analysis, subjects missing 8-week outcomes data were classified as treatment failures regardless of their outcomes at earlier evaluations. As part of the sensitivity analysis, a last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) approach to impute missing 8-week efficacy outcomes also examined treatment. Secondary endpoints included treatment success as a function of baseline ISGA score (mild or moderate), ISGA score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear), and effects of treatment on target lesion. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the study. In the ITT population of Study 1, treatment success after 8 weeks was achieved by 14% of subjects in the calcipotriene foam group versus 7% of subjects in the vehicle foam group (p = 0.058). In the LOCF analysis, treatment success was achieved by more subjects with calcipotriene foam than with vehicle foam (15% vs 7%; p = 0.034). In Study 2, treatment success was achieved by more subjects in the calcipotriene foam group for the primary endpoint (27% vs 16%; p = 0.016) and the LOCF analysis (28% vs 16%; p = 0.010). Subjects in the calcipotriene foam group exhibited better response rates than did the vehicle foam group for most of the secondary outcomes. Calcipotriene foam was safe with an overall incidence of AEs similar to those experienced in the vehicle foam group. Application-site reactions were noted in approximately 1-2% of subjects in each group. No AE was reported in more than 2% of subjects in the calcipotriene foam group. Treatment was discontinued because of AEs in approximately 2% of subjects in both groups.

Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is caused by polyglutamine expansion in the androgen receptor, which results in ligand-dependent toxicity. Animal models have a neuromuscular deficit that is mitigated by androgen-reducing treatment. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of the 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor dutasteride in patients with SBMA, and to identify outcome measures for use in future studies of the disease. We undertook a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-site clinical trial in ambulatory, symptomatic men with genetically confirmed SBMA. Participants were assigned by random number table to receive dutasteride (0\u00b75 mg per day) or placebo orally for 24 months. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome measure was quantitative muscle assessment (QMA). The final efficacy analysis included all patients who were compliant with study treatment at 24 months. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00303446. 50 men were randomly assigned to treatment groups (25 dutasteride, 25 placebo), and 44 were included in the efficacy analysis (21 dutasteride, 23 placebo). At 24 months, the placebo group showed a decrease of 4\u00b75% (-0\u00b730 kg/kg) from baseline in weight-scaled muscle strength as indicated by QMA, and the dutasteride group had an increase in strength of 1\u00b73% (0\u00b714 kg/kg); the difference between groups (5\u00b78%, 95% CI -5\u00b79 to 17\u00b76; p=0\u00b728) was not significant. Prespecified secondary outcome measures of creatine kinase, muscle strength and function, motor nerve conduction, activities of daily living, and erectile function did not show a significant difference between the study groups in change from baseline. Quality of life, as measured by the physical component summary of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form version 2, favoured dutasteride (change in score from baseline: placebo, -3\u00b76%, vs dutasteride, 2\u00b71%; p=0\u00b701), whereas the mental component summary favoured placebo (3\u00b73%vs -3\u00b72%; p=0\u00b703). The dutasteride group had fewer patients reporting falls than did the placebo group (9 vs 16; p=0\u00b7048); there were no other significant differences in reported adverse events. Our study did not show a significant effect of dutasteride on the progression of muscle weakness in SBMA, although there were secondary indications of both positive and negative effects compared with placebo.

Metabolic syndrome (METS) is an increasingly prevalent but poorly understood clinical condition characterized by insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and obesity. Increased oxidative stress catalyzed by accumulation of iron in excess of physiologic requirements has been implicated in the pathogenesis of METS, but the relationships between cause and effect remain uncertain. We tested the hypothesis that phlebotomy-induced reduction of body iron stores would alter the clinical presentation of METS, using a randomized trial. In a randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical trial, 64 patients with METS were randomly assigned to iron reduction by phlebotomy (n = 33) or to a control group (n = 31), which was offered phlebotomy at the end of the study (waiting-list design). The iron-reduction patients had 300 ml of blood removed at entry and between 250 and 500 ml removed after 4 weeks, depending on ferritin levels at study entry. Primary outcomes were change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and insulin sensitivity as measured by Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA) index after 6 weeks. Secondary outcomes included HbA1c, plasma glucose, blood lipids, and heart rate (HR). SBP decreased from 148.5 \u00b1 12.3 mmHg to 130.5 \u00b1 11.8 mmHg in the phlebotomy group, and from 144.7 \u00b1 14.4 mmHg to 143.8 \u00b1 11.9 mmHg in the control group (difference -16.6 mmHg; 95% CI -20.7 to -12.5; P < 0.001). No significant effect on HOMA index was seen. With regard to secondary outcomes, blood glucose, HbA1c, low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein ratio, and HR were significantly decreased by phlebotomy. Changes in BP and HOMA index correlated with ferritin reduction. In patients with METS, phlebotomy, with consecutive reduction of body iron stores, lowered BP and resulted in improvements in markers of cardiovascular risk and glycemic control.

Seven patients with type 1 diabetes and end-stage renal failure were transplanted with allogenic islets and kidneys procured from brain-dead donors.

Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, could be useful for treating pulmonary hypertension (PH) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, vasodilators may inhibit hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and impair gas exchange in this condition. To assess the acute hemodynamic and gas exchange effects of sildenafil in patients with COPD-associated PH. We conducted a randomized, dose comparison trial in 20 patients with COPD-associated PH. Eleven patients were assigned to 20 mg, and 9 patients to 40 mg, of sildenafil. Pulmonary hemodynamics and gas exchange, including ventilation-perfusion (V(A)/Q) relationships, were assessed at rest and during constant-work rate exercise, before and 1 hour after sildenafil administration. Both sildenafil doses reduced the mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) at rest and during exercise, without differences between them. Overall, PAP decreased -6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [95% CI], -7 to -4) at rest and -11 mm Hg (95% CI, -14 to -8) during exercise. After sildenafil, Pa(O(2)) decreased -6 mm Hg (95% CI, -8 to -4) at rest because of increased perfusion in units with low V(A)/Q ratio, without differences between doses. No change in Pa(O(2)) (95% CI, -3 to 0.2 mm Hg) or V(A)/Q relationships occurred during exercise after sildenafil. Changes induced by sildenafil in Pa(O(2)) and V(A)/Q distributions at rest correlated with their respective values at baseline. In patients with COPD-associated PH, sildenafil improves pulmonary hemodynamics at rest and during exercise. This effect is accompanied by the inhibition of hypoxic vasoconstriction, which impairs arterial oxygenation at rest.

Participants and study investigators and personnel were masked to study group assignment. Participants were followed-up for 5 years by primary-care physicians and in expert memory centres. The primary outcome was conversion to probable Alzheimer's disease in participants who received at least one dose of study drug or placebo, compared by use of the log-rank test. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00276510. Between March, 2002, and November, 2004, we enrolled and randomly allocated 2854 participants, of whom 1406 received at least one dose of ginkgo biloba extract and 1414 received at least one dose of placebo. By 5 years, 61 participants in the ginkgo group had been diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease (1\u00b72 cases per 100 person-years) compared with 73 participants in the placebo group (1\u00b74 cases per 100 person-years; hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b784, 95% CI 0\u00b760-1\u00b718; p=0\u00b7306), but the risk was not proportional over time. Incidence of adverse events was much the same between groups. 76 participants in the ginkgo group died compared with 82 participants in the placebo group (0\u00b794, 0\u00b769-1\u00b728; p=0\u00b768). 65 participants in the ginkgo group had a stroke compared with 60 participants in the placebo group (risk ratio 1\u00b712, 95% CI 0\u00b777-1\u00b763; p=0\u00b757). Incidence of other haemorrhagic or cardiovascular events also did not differ between groups. Long-term use of standardised ginkgo biloba extract in this trial did not reduce the risk of progression to Alzheimer's disease compared with placebo. Ipsen.

A total of 381 patients were randomly assigned to receive either the test drug, 16 mg/2 ml (0.8%) highly purified ia hyaluronic acid of biofermentative origin (Sinovial(\u00ae)), or the comparative drug, 16 mg/2 ml of 0.8% hylan G-F20 (Synvisc(\u00ae)). The duration of the treatment was 2 weeks (three injections at 1-week interval), followed by an observation period of 6 months. The primary efficacy variable was the improvement in mean Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) pain subscore from baseline to the final visit (week 26), compared between the two treatment groups. The acceptable margin for non-inferiority was chosen to be 8 mm. At week 26, WOMAC pain subscores decreased by a mean of 32.5 for both Sinovial(\u00ae) and Synvisc(\u00ae). These results met prespecified criteria for non-inferiority for both the Intent-to-Treat and Per-Protocol populations.

Vitamin/mineral supplements are among the most commonly used treatments for autism, but the research on their use for treating autism has been limited. This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled three month vitamin/mineral treatment study. The study involved 141 children and adults with autism, and pre and post symptoms of autism were assessed. None of the participants had taken a vitamin/mineral supplement in the two months prior to the start of the study. For a subset of the participants (53 children ages 5-16) pre and post measurements of nutritional and metabolic status were also conducted. The vitamin/mineral supplement was generally well-tolerated, and individually titrated to optimum benefit. Levels of many vitamins, minerals, and biomarkers improved/increased showing good compliance and absorption. Statistically significant improvements in metabolic status were many including: total sulfate (+17%, p = 0.001), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM; +6%, p = 0.003), reduced glutathione (+17%, p = 0.0008), ratio of oxidized glutathione to reduced glutathione (GSSG:GSH; -27%, p = 0.002), nitrotyrosine (-29%, p = 0.004), ATP (+25%, p = 0.000001), NADH (+28%, p = 0.0002), and NADPH (+30%, p = 0.001). Most of these metabolic biomarkers improved to normal or near-normal levels.The supplement group had significantly greater improvements than the placebo group on the Parental Global Impressions-Revised (PGI-R, Average Change, p = 0.008), and on the subscores for Hyperactivity (p = 0.003), Tantrumming (p = 0.009), Overall (p = 0.02), and Receptive Language (p = 0.03). For the other three assessment tools the difference between treatment group and placebo group was not statistically significant.Regression analysis revealed that the degree of improvement on the Average Change of the PGI-R was strongly associated with several biomarkers (adj.

Subjects were randomly assigned to groups that were given 20 mg (n = 46) or 40 mg (n = 52) basiliximab or placebo (n = 51) at weeks 0, 2, and 4. All subjects received 30 mg/day prednisone through week 2; the dose was reduced by 5 mg each week to 20 mg/day, which was maintained until week 8. At week 8, we compared the rates of clinical remission (Mayo score \u22642, no subscore >1) for patients given basiliximab with the rate for patients given placebo. Twenty-eight percent of patients given placebo, 29% of those given the 40-mg dose of basiliximab, and 26% of those given the 20-mg dose of basiliximab achieved clinical remission (P = 1.00 vs placebo for each dose). Basiliximab was generally well tolerated. Six subjects who received basiliximab had serious adverse events (6.1%) compared with 2 who received placebo (3.9%; P = .72). In subjects given basiliximab, incomplete saturation of CD25 (<50%) on peripheral T cells was associated with the presence of anti-basiliximab antibodies (odds ratio, 21; 95% confidence interval, 2.4-184). Basiliximab does not increase the effect of corticosteroids in the induction of remission in outpatients with corticosteroid-resistant moderate to severe UC.

Sleep deprivation is common in Western societies and is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in epidemiological studies. However, the effects of partial sleep deprivation on the cardiovascular system are poorly understood. In the present study, we evaluated 13 healthy male volunteers (age: 31 \u00b1 2 yr) monitoring sleep diary and wrist actigraphy during their daily routine for 12 nights. The subjects were randomized and crossover to 5 nights of control sleep (>7 h) or 5 nights of partial sleep deprivation (<5 h), interposed by 2 nights of unrestricted sleep. At the end of control and partial sleep deprivation periods, heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure variability (BPV), serum norepinephrine, and venous endothelial function (dorsal hand vein technique) were measured at rest in a supine position. The subjects slept 8.0 \u00b1 0.5 and 4.5 \u00b1 0.3 h during control and partial sleep deprivation periods, respectively (P < 0.01). Compared with control, sleep deprivation caused significant increase in sympathetic activity as evidenced by increase in percent low-frequency (50 \u00b1 15 vs. 59 \u00b1 8) and a decrease in percent high-frequency (50 \u00b1 10 vs. 41 \u00b1 8) components of HRV, increase in low-frequency band of BPV, and increase in serum norepinephrine (119 \u00b1 46 vs. 162 \u00b1 58 ng/ml), as well as a reduction in maximum endothelial dependent venodilatation (100 \u00b1 22 vs. 41 \u00b1 20%; P < 0.05 for all comparisons). In conclusion, 5 nights of partial sleep deprivation is sufficient to cause significant increase in sympathetic activity and venous endothelial dysfunction. These results may help to explain the association between short sleep and increased cardiovascular risk in epidemiological studies.

Stimulation with recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) before radioiodine (131I) therapy augments goiter volume reduction (GVR). Observations indicate that rhTSH has a preconditioning effect beyond increasing thyroid (131)I uptake. We test the hypothesis that an equivalent GVR might be obtained by an absorbed thyroid dose well below what has been used previously. In a double-blinded setup, 90 patients (78 women; median age, 52 yr; range, 22-83) with a nontoxic nodular goiter (median size, 63 ml; range, 25-379 ml) were randomized to either 0.1 mg rhTSH (n=60) followed by a thyroid dose of 50 Gy or placebo followed by 100 Gy (n=30). At 12 months, the mean relative GVR in the placebo and the rhTSH group was identical (35+/-3%; P=0.81). The median administered 131I-activity was 170 MBq (45-1269) in the rhTSH group and 559 MBq (245-3530) in the placebo group (70% reduction, P<0.0001). According to the official radiation regulation, hospitalization was required in 14 patients in the placebo group vs. one patient in the rhTSH group (P<0.0001). In both groups, goiter-related symptoms were effectively relieved in the majority of patients. The prevalence of myxedema (10%) did not differ among groups. This is the first study to demonstrate that rhTSH not only increases the thyroid 131I uptake, but per se potentiates the effect of 131I-therapy, allowing a major reduction of the 131I-activity without compromising efficacy. This approach is attractive in terms of minimizing posttherapeutic restrictions and in reducing the potential risk of radiation-induced malignancy.

This study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of both routes of nutritional intervention. A randomized clinical trial was conducted in a tertiary surgical center of pancreatic and gastrointestinal surgery. Seventy-eight patients with postoperative pancreatic fistula were treated conservatively and randomly assigned to groups receiving for 30 days either enteral nutrition or total parenteral nutrition.

The method of generalized estimating equations (GEE) models the association between the repeated observations on a subject with a patterned correlation matrix. Correct specification of the underlying structure is a potentially beneficial goal, in terms of improving efficiency and enhancing scientific understanding. We consider two sets of criteria that have previously been suggested, respectively, for selecting an appropriate working correlation structure, and for ruling out a particular structure(s), in the GEE analysis of longitudinal studies with binary outcomes. The first selection criterion chooses the structure for which the model-based and the sandwich-based estimator of the covariance matrix of the regression parameter estimator are closest, while the second selection criterion chooses the structure that minimizes the weighted error sum of squares. The rule out criterion deselects structures for which the estimated correlation parameter violates standard constraints for binary data that depend on the marginal means.

Morbid obesity predisposes patients to lung collapse and hypoxemia during induction of anesthesia. The aim of this prospective study was to determine whether noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) improves arterial oxygenation and end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) compared with conventional preoxygenation, and whether NPPV followed by early recruitment maneuver (RM) after endotracheal intubation (ETI) further improves oxygenation and respiratory function compared with NPPV alone. Sixty-six consecutive patients (body mass index, 46 \u00b1 6 kg/m\u00b2) were randomized to receive 5 min of either conventional preoxygenation with spontaneous breathing of 100% O\u2082 (CON), NPPV (pressure support and positive end-expiratory pressure), or NPPV followed by RM (NPPV+RM). Gas exchange was measured in awake patients, at the end of preoxygenation, immediately after ETI, and 5 min after the onset of mechanical ventilation. EELV was measured immediately after ETI and 5 min after mechanical ventilation. The primary endpoint was arterial oxygenation 5 min after the onset of mechanical ventilation. Results are presented as mean \u00b1 SD. At the end of preoxygenation, Pao\u2082 was higher in the NPPV and NPPV+RM groups (382 \u00b1 87 mmHg and 375 \u00b1 82 mmHg, respectively; both P < 0.001) compared with the CON group (306 \u00b1 51 mmHg) and remained higher after ETI (225 \u00b1 104 mmHg and 221 \u00b1 110 mmHg, in the NPPV and NPPV+RM groups, respectively; both P < 0.01 compared with the CON group [150 \u00b1 50 mmHg]). After the onset of mechanical ventilation, Pao\u2082 was 93 \u00b1 25 mmHg in the CON group, 128 \u00b1 54 mmHg in the NPPV group (P = 0.035 vs. CON group), and 234 \u00b1 73 mmHg in the NPPV+RM group (P < 0.0001 vs. NPPV group). After ETI, EELV was higher in the NPPV group compared with the CON group (P < 0.001). Compared with NPPV alone, RM further improved gas exchange and EELV (all P < 0.05). A significant correlation was found between Pao2 obtained 5 min after mechanical ventilation and EELV (R = 0.41, P < 0.001). NPPV improves oxygenation and EELV in morbidly obese patients compared with conventional preoxygenation. NPPV combined with early RM is more effective than NPPV alone at improving respiratory function after ETI.

Renal insufficiency increases the half-life of low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs). Whether continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) removes LMWHs is unsettled. We studied hemostasis during nadroparin anticoagulation for CVVH, and explored the implication of the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP). This cross-over study, performed in a 20-bed teaching hospital ICU, randomized non-surgical patients with acute kidney injury requiring nadroparin for CVVH to compare hemostasis between two doses of CVVH: filtrate flow was initiated at 4 L/h and converted to 2 L/h after 60 min in group 1, and vice versa in group 2. Patients received nadroparin 2850 IU i.v., followed by 380 IU/h continuously in the extracorporeal circuit. After baseline sampling, ultrafiltrate, arterial (art) and postfilter (PF) blood was taken for hemostatic markers after 1 h, and 15 min, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h after converting filtrate flow. We compared randomized groups, and 'early circuit clotting' to 'normal circuit life' groups. Fourteen patients were randomized, seven to each group. Despite randomization, group 1 had higher SOFA scores (median 14 (IQR 11-15) versus 9 (IQR 5-9), p = 0.004). Anti-Xa art activity peaked upon nadroparin bolus and declined thereafter (p = 0.05). Anti-Xa PF did not change in time. Anti-Xa activity was not detected in ultrafiltrate. Medians of all anti-Xa samples were lower in group 1 (anti-Xa art 0.19 (0.12-0.37) vs. 0.31 (0.23-0.52), p = 0.02; anti-Xa PF 0.34 (0.25-0.44) vs. 0.51 (0.41-0.76), p = 0.005). After a steep decline, arterial ETPAUC tended to increase (p = 0.06), opposite to anti-Xa, while postfilter ETPAUC increased (p = 0.001). Median circuit life was 24.5 h (IQR 12-37 h). Patients with 'short circuit life' had longer baseline prothrombin time (PTT), activated thromboplastin time (aPTT), lower ETP, higher thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT) and higher SOFA scores; during CVVH, anti-Xa, and platelets were lower; PTT, aPTT, TAT and D-dimers were longer/higher and ETP was slower and depressed. We found no accumulation and no removal of LMWH activity during CVVH. However, we found that early circuit clotting was associated with more severe organ failure, prior systemic thrombin generation with consumptive coagulopathy, heparin resistance and elevated extracorporeal thrombin generation.

Therefore, quality of life (QoL) assessment is of particular importance to demonstrate new treatment value. Following the demonstration of the superiority of catumaxomab and paracentesis over paracentesis on puncture-free survival, this analysis aimed at comparing deterioration in QoL between both the treatment options. In a randomised, multicentre, phase II/III study of patients with MA due to epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) positive cancer, the QoL was evaluated using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 items (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaire at screening, 1, 3 and 7 months after treatment and in the case of re-puncture on the day of paracentesis. Time to first deterioration in QoL was defined as a decrease in the QoL score of at least five points and compared between the catumaxomab (n=160) and control (n=85) groups using the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for baseline score, country and primary tumour type. Deterioration in QoL scores appeared more rapidly in the control than in the catumaxomab group (median 19-26 days versus 47-49 days). The difference in time to deterioration in QoL between the groups was statistically significant for all scores (P<0.01). The hazard ratios ranged from 0.08 to 0.24 (P<0.01).

Olaparib, a novel, orally active poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, induced synthetic lethality in BRCA-deficient cells. A maximum tolerated dose and initial signal of efficacy in BRCA-deficient ovarian cancers have been reported. We therefore assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of olaparib alone in women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and advanced breast cancer. Women (aged >or=18 years) with confirmed BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and recurrent, advanced breast cancer were assigned to two sequential cohorts in a phase 2 study undertaken in 16 centres in Australia, Germany, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the USA. The first cohort (n=27) was given continuous oral olaparib at the maximum tolerated dose (400 mg twice daily), and the second (n=27) was given a lower dose (100 mg twice daily). The primary efficacy endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00494234. Patients had been given a median of three previous chemotherapy regimens (range 1-5 in cohort 1, and 2-4 in cohort 2). ORR was 11 (41%) of 27 patients (95% CI 25-59) in the cohort assigned to 400 mg twice daily, and six (22%) of 27 (11-41) in the cohort assigned to 100 mg twice daily. Toxicities were mainly at low grades. The most frequent causally related adverse events in the cohort given 400 mg twice daily were fatigue (grade 1 or 2, 11 [41%]; grade 3 or 4, four [15%]), nausea (grade 1 or 2, 11 [41%]; grade 3 or 4, four [15%]), vomiting (grade 1 or 2, three [11%]; grade 3 or 4, three [11%]), and anaemia (grade 1 or 2, one [4%]; grade 3 or 4, three [11%]). The most frequent causally related adverse events in the cohort given 100 mg twice daily were nausea (grade 1 or 2, 11 [41%]; none grade 3 or 4) and fatigue (grade 1 or 2, seven [26%]; grade 3 or 4, one [4%]). The results of this study provide positive proof of concept for PARP inhibition in BRCA-deficient breast cancers and shows a favourable therapeutic index for a novel targeted treatment strategy in patients with tumours that have genetic loss of function of BRCA1-associated or BRCA2-associated DNA repair.

Each arm compared two dose levels of inhaled ciclesonide that were administered for 3 weeks with a washout period of 3 to 8 weeks, as follows: (1) 40 vs 160 microg daily; and (2) 80 vs 320 microg daily. Baseline and weekly assessments with exercise challenge and sputum analysis were performed. Data were pooled and demonstrated that 10 subjects had baseline sputum eosinophilia >or= 5%. Only high-dose ICS therapy (ie, 160 and 320 microg) significantly attenuated the sputum eosinophil percentage. Sputum eosinophil percentage significantly correlated with EIB severity, and predicted the magnitude and temporal response of EIB to high-dose therapy, but not to low-dose therapy (ie, 40 and 80 microg). Low-dose ICS therapy provided a significant reduction in EIB at 1 week, with little additional improvement thereafter, irrespective of baseline sputum eosinophil counts. In contrast, high-dose ICS therapy provided a significantly greater improvement in EIB in subjects with sputum eosinophilia compared to those with an eosinophil count of < 5%. The difference between the eosinophilic groups in the magnitude of improvement in EIB was evident after the first week of high-dose ICS therapy and increased with time. These results suggest that eosinophilic airway inflammation may be important in modifying the severity of EIB and the response to ICS therapy.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate if superior glycaemic control could be achieved with Avandamet\u00ae (rosiglitazone/metformin/AVM) compared with metformin (MET) monotherapy, and if glycaemic effects attained with AVM are durable over 18 months of treatment. Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone biomarkers were evaluated in a subgroup of patients. This was a phase IV, randomized, double-blind, multi-centre study in 688, drug na\u00cfve, male and female patients who had an established clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Patients were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio either to AVM or MET. As initial therapy in patients with T2DM, AVM was superior to MET in achieving statistically significant reductions in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (p < 0.0001) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (p < 0.001), with more patients reaching recommended HbA1c and FPG targets for intensive glycaemic control. The glycaemic effects attained with AVM compared to MET monotherapy were durable over 18 months of treatment. In the bone substudy, AVM was associated with a significantly lower BMD in comparison with MET at week 80 in the lumbar spine and total hip (p < 0.0012 and p = 0.0005, respectively). Between-treatment differences were not statistically significant for distal one-third of radius BMD, femoral neck BMD or total BMD. Superior glycaemic control was achieved with AVM compared with MET monotherapy. The superior glycaemic effects were shown to be durable over 18 months of treatment.

Topical field therapy currently requires weeks or months of treatment. We investigated the efficacy and safety of a new topical field therapy for actinic keratosis, ingenol mebutate gel (0.015% for face and scalp and 0.05% for trunk and extremities). In four multicenter, randomized, double-blind studies, we randomly assigned patients with actinic keratoses on the face or scalp or on the trunk or extremities to receive ingenol mebutate or placebo (vehicle), self-applied to a 25-cm(2) contiguous field once daily for 3 consecutive days for lesions on the face or scalp or for 2 consecutive days for the trunk or extremities. Complete clearance (primary outcome) was assessed at 57 days, and local reactions were quantitatively measured. In a pooled analysis of the two trials involving the face and scalp, the rate of complete clearance was higher with ingenol mebutate than with placebo (42.2% vs. 3.7%, P<0.001). Local reactions peaked at day 4, with a mean maximum composite score of 9.1 on the local-skin-response scale (which ranges from 0 to 4 for six types of reaction, yielding a composite score of 0 to 24, with higher numbers indicating more severe reactions), rapidly decreased by day 8, and continued to decrease, approaching baseline scores by day 29. In a pooled analysis of the two trials involving the trunk and extremities, the rate of complete clearance was also higher with ingenol mebutate than with placebo (34.1% vs. 4.7%, P<0.001). Local skin reactions peaked between days 3 and 8 and declined rapidly, approaching baseline by day 29, with a mean maximum score of 6.8.

This double-blind, randomized cross-over, multi-center study was conducted in metformin-treated T2D patients: 54% female; BMI: 33 +/- 5 kg/m(2); HbA(1c): 8.5 +/- 1.2%; 2-h PPG: 245 +/- 65 mg/dL. Patients received exenatide (5 microg BID for 1 week, then 10 microg BID for 1 week) or sitagliptin (100 mg QAM) for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, patients crossed-over to the alternate therapy. Postprandial glycemic measures were assessed via standard meal test; caloric intake assessed by ad libitum dinner (subset of patients). Gastric emptying was assessed by acetaminophen absorption (Clinicaltrials.gov Registry Number: NCT00477581). After 2 weeks of therapy, 2-h PPG was lower with exenatide versus sitagliptin: 133 +/- 6 mg/dL versus 208 +/- 6 mg/dL, p < 0.0001 (evaluable, N = 61). Switching from exenatide to sitagliptin increased 2-h PPG by +73 +/- 11 mg/dL, while switching from sitagliptin to exenatide further reduced 2-h PPG by -76 +/- 10 mg/dL. Postprandial glucose parameters (AUC, C(ave), C(max)) were lower with exenatide than sitagliptin (p < 0.0001). Reduction in fasting glucose was similar with exenatide and sitagliptin (-15 +/- 4 mg/dL vs. -19 +/- 4 mg/dL, p = 0.3234). Compared to sitagliptin, exenatide improved the insulinogenic index of insulin secretion (ratio exenatide to sitagliptin: 1.50 +/- 0.26, p = 0.0239), reduced postprandial glucagon (AUC ratio exenatide to sitagliptin: 0.88 +/- 0.03, p = 0.0011), reduced postprandial triglycerides (AUC ratio exenatide to sitagliptin: 0.90 +/- 0.04, p = 0.0118), and slowed gastric emptying (acetaminophen AUC ratio exenatide to sitagliptin: 0.56 +/- 0.05, p < 0.0001). Exenatide reduced total caloric intake compared to sitagliptin (-134 +/- 97 kcal vs. +130 +/- 97 kcal, p = 0.0227, N = 25). Common adverse events with both treatments were mild to moderate in intensity and gastrointestinal in nature. Although this study was limited by a 2-week duration of exposure, these data demonstrate that, exenatide had: (i) a greater effect than sitagliptin to lower postprandial glucose and (ii) a more potent effect to increase insulin secretion and reduce postprandial glucagon secretion in T2D patients. In contrast to sitagliptin, exenatide slowed gastric emptying and reduced caloric intake. These key findings differentiate the therapeutic actions of the two incretin-based approaches, and may have meaningful clinical implications.

Evaluation using ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in carotid disease.  The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of low-dose (10 mg) and high-dose (80 mg) atorvastatin on carotid plaque inflammation as determined by ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO)-enhanced carotid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The hypothesis was that treatment with 80 mg atorvastatin would demonstrate quantifiable changes in USPIO-enhanced MRI-defined inflammation within the first 3 months of therapy. Preliminary studies indicate that USPIO-enhanced MRI can identify macrophage infiltration in human carotid atheroma in vivo and hence may be a surrogate marker of plaque inflammation. Forty-seven patients with carotid stenosis >40% on duplex ultrasonography and who demonstrated intraplaque accumulation of USPIO on MRI at baseline were randomly assigned in a balanced, double-blind manner to either 10 or 80 mg atorvastatin daily for 12 weeks. Baseline statin therapy was equivalent to 10 mg of atorvastatin or less. The primary end point was change from baseline in signal intensity (DeltaSI) on USPIO-enhanced MRI in carotid plaque at 6 and 12 weeks. Twenty patients completed 12 weeks of treatment in each group. A significant reduction from baseline in USPIO-defined inflammation was observed in the 80-mg group at both 6 weeks (DeltaSI 0.13; p = 0.0003) and at 12 weeks (DeltaSI 0.20; p < 0.0001). No difference was observed with the low-dose regimen. The 80-mg atorvastatin dose significantly reduced total cholesterol by 15% (p = 0.0003) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 29% (p = 0.0001) at 12 weeks. Aggressive lipid-lowering therapy over a 3-month period is associated with significant reduction in USPIO-defined inflammation.

To examine whether access to a website with individually tailored feedback and suggestions on how to increase PA led to improved PA, anthropometrics, and health measurements. Physically inactive adults (n = 12,287) participating in a nationwide eHealth survey and health examination in Denmark were randomly assigned to either an intervention (website) (n = 6055) or a no-intervention control group (n = 6232) in 2008. The intervention website was founded on the theories of stages of change and of planned behavior and, apart from a forum page where a physiotherapist answered questions about PA and training, was fully automated. After 3 and again after 6 months we emailed participants invitations to answer a Web-based follow-up questionnaire, which included the long version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. A subgroup of participants (n = 1190) were invited to a follow-up health examination at 3 months. Less than 22.0% (694/3156) of the participants logged on to the website once and only 7.0% (222/3159) logged on frequently. We found no difference in PA level between the website and control groups at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. By dividing participants into three groups according to use of the intervention website, we found a significant difference in total and leisure-time PA in the website group. The follow-up health examination showed no significant reductions in body mass index, waist circumference, body fat percentage, and blood pressure, or improvements in arm strength and aerobic fitness in the website group. Based on our findings, we suggest that active users of a Web-based PA intervention can improve their level of PA. However, for unmotivated users, single-tailored feedback may be too brief. Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated interventions with the potential to reach both motivated and unmotivated sedentary individuals.

Treating actinic keratoses and the surrounding skin area (i.e., field therapy) can eradicate clinical and subclinical actinic keratoses. Topical field therapy currently requires weeks or months of treatment. We investigated the efficacy and safety of a new topical field therapy for actinic keratosis, ingenol mebutate gel (0.015% for face and scalp and 0.05% for trunk and extremities). In four multicenter, randomized, double-blind studies, we randomly assigned patients with actinic keratoses on the face or scalp or on the trunk or extremities to receive ingenol mebutate or placebo (vehicle), self-applied to a 25-cm(2) contiguous field once daily for 3 consecutive days for lesions on the face or scalp or for 2 consecutive days for the trunk or extremities. Complete clearance (primary outcome) was assessed at 57 days, and local reactions were quantitatively measured. In a pooled analysis of the two trials involving the face and scalp, the rate of complete clearance was higher with ingenol mebutate than with placebo (42.2% vs. 3.7%, P<0.001). Local reactions peaked at day 4, with a mean maximum composite score of 9.1 on the local-skin-response scale (which ranges from 0 to 4 for six types of reaction, yielding a composite score of 0 to 24, with higher numbers indicating more severe reactions), rapidly decreased by day 8, and continued to decrease, approaching baseline scores by day 29. In a pooled analysis of the two trials involving the trunk and extremities, the rate of complete clearance was also higher with ingenol mebutate than with placebo (34.1% vs. 4.7%, P<0.001). Local skin reactions peaked between days 3 and 8 and declined rapidly, approaching baseline by day 29, with a mean maximum score of 6.8.

Targeting of VEGF is a potential therapeutic option in patients with malignant ovarian ascites. We present the final results of a multicentre study of the efficacy and safety of aflibercept, a potent inhibitor of both VEGF and placental growth factor, in the treatment of malignant ascites. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 2 study, patients with advanced chemoresistant ovarian cancer and recurrent symptomatic malignant ascites were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive voice response system to either intravenous aflibercept (4 mg/kg every 2 weeks) or placebo, stratified by interval of time (\u2264 2 weeks vs > 2 weeks) between the two most recent paracenteses before randomisation. Patients participated in the double-blind period (during which patients, investigators, and sponsor personnel were masked to treatment assignment) until they had a repeat paracentesis and for at least 60 days, and could also participate in an optional open-label period during which all patients received aflibercept. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to repeat paracentesis based on response during the double-blind period alone, and was analysed in the intention-to-treat population with censoring of patients who did not have a repeat paracentesis as of the last day of the double-blind period. Safety analyses included both double-blind and open-label periods. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00327444. 55 patients with a median of four (range two to 11) previous lines of chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n=26) or aflibercept (n=29). Mean time to repeat paracentesis was significantly longer with aflibercept than with placebo (55\u00b71 [SE 7\u00b73] vs 23\u00b73 [7\u00b77] days; difference 31\u00b78 days, 95% CI 10\u00b76-53\u00b71; p=0\u00b70019). In the aflibercept group, two patients did not need a repeat paracentesis during 6 months of double-blind treatment. The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events were dyspnoea (six [20%] aflibercept vs two [8%] placebo), fatigue or asthenia (four [13%] vs 11 [44%]), and dehydration (three [10%] vs three [12%]). The frequency of fatal gastrointestinal events was higher with aflibercept (three intestinal perforations) than with placebo (one intestinal fistula leading to sepsis). This study shows the effectiveness of VEGF blockade in the reduction of malignant ascites, but confirms the significant clinical risk of fatal bowel perforation in this population of patients with very advanced cancer. VEGF blockade should be used with caution in advanced ovarian cancer with abdominal carcinomatosis, and the benefit-risk balance should be thoroughly discussed for each patient. Sanofi Oncology.

This study was undertaken to examine whether monthly C.E.R.A. using pre-filled syringes maintains stable haemoglobin levels when administered according to local clinical judgement. MIRACEL was a prospective, open-label, single-arm, multicentre study performed at 90 nephrology centres in Germany. After a 2-month screening phase, haemodialysis patients receiving epoetin or darbepoetin were converted to monthly intravenous C.E.R.A., with a 5-month titration phase followed by a 2-month evaluation phase. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00413894 RESULTS: Of 661 patients screened, 424 (64.1%) started C.E.R.A. therapy (previous treatment: 72.2% epoetin, 27.8% darbepoetin); 416 were eligible for inclusion in the intent-to-treat population. A mean of two C.E.R.A. dose changes were required during the 7-month treatment period. The primary efficacy variable, haemoglobin within 11-12.5 g/dL or 10-13 g/dL during the evaluation phase, was achieved in 109 (30.8%) and 265 (74.9%) of the 354 evaluable patients, respectively, with no differences observed between patients formerly receiving epoetin or darbepoetin or different dosing frequencies. During the screening, titration and evaluation phases, mean haemoglobin was 11.7 +/- 0.7 g/dL, 11.6 +/- 0.9 g/dL and 11.4 +/- 1.0 g/dL, respectively, and 90.6% (377/416), 70.4% (293/416) and 82.9% (345/416) of patients exhibited < or = 1 g/dL change from phase-specific individual means.

Patients were enrolled from April 1997 through January 2005 in an autologous nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) study at a single US medical center. Peripheral blood stem cells were mobilized with cyclophosphamide (2.0 g/m2) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (5 microg/kg per day), enriched ex vivo by CD34+ immunoselection, cryopreserved, and reinfused after treatment with cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) and equine antithymocyte globulin (90 mg/kg). The primary end point was survival, both overall and disease-free. Secondary end points included SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), serology (antinuclear antibody [ANA] and anti-double-stranded (ds) DNA), complement C3 and C4, and changes in renal and pulmonary organ function assessed before treatment and at 6 months, 12 months, and then yearly for 5 years. Fifty patients were enrolled and underwent stem cell mobilization. Two patients died after mobilization, one from disseminated mucormycosis and another from active lupus after postponing the transplantation for 4 months. Forty-eight patients underwent nonmyeloablative HSCT. Treatment-related mortality was 2% (1/50). By intention to treat, treatment-related mortality was 4% (2/50). With a mean follow-up of 29 months (range, 6 months to 7.5 years) for patients undergoing HSCT, overall 5-year survival was 84%, and probability of disease-free survival at 5 years following HSCT was 50%. Secondary analysis demonstrated stabilization of renal function and significant improvement in SLEDAI score, ANA, anti-ds DNA, complement, and carbon monoxide diffusion lung capacity adjusted for hemoglobin. In treatment-refractory SLE, autologous nonmyeloablative HSCT results in amelioration of disease activity, improvement in serologic markers, and either stabilization or reversal of organ dysfunction.

Disease-free survival (DFS) was significantly superior in patients with no invasive and no in situ residuals in breast or nodes (n = 955) compared with patients with residual ductal carcinoma in situ only (n = 309), no invasive residuals in breast but involved nodes (n = 186), only focal-invasive disease in the breast (n = 478), and gross invasive residual disease (n = 4,449; P < .001). Hazard ratios for DFS comparing patients with or without pCR were lowest when defined as no invasive and no in situ residuals (0.446) and increased monotonously when in situ residuals (0.523), no invasive breast residuals but involved nodes (0.623), and focal-invasive disease (0.727) were included in the definition. pCR was associated with improved DFS in luminal B/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -negative (P = .005), HER2-positive/nonluminal (P < .001), and triple-negative (P < .001) tumors but not in luminal A (P = .39) or luminal B/HER2-positive (P = .45) breast cancer. pCR in HER2-positive (nonluminal) and triple-negative tumors was associated with excellent prognosis. pCR defined as no invasive and no in situ residuals in breast and nodes can best discriminate between patients with favorable and unfavorable outcomes. Patients with noninvasive or focal-invasive residues or involved lymph nodes should not be considered as having achieved pCR. pCR is a suitable surrogate end point for patients with luminal B/HER2-negative, HER2-positive (nonluminal), and triple-negative disease but not for those with luminal B/HER2-positive or luminal A tumors.

We assessed the efficacy and safety of linaclotide at a daily dose range of 75-600 \u03bcg in IBS-C. We performed a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study of 420 patients with IBS-C given oral linaclotide at doses of 75, 150, 300, or 600 \u03bcg or placebo once daily for 12 weeks. End points included change from baseline in daily bowel habits, daily abdominal symptoms, and weekly global assessments, in addition to responder criteria. All doses of linaclotide significantly improved bowel habits, including frequency of spontaneous bowel movements and complete spontaneous bowel movements (primary end point), severity of straining, and stool consistency. Abdominal pain was significantly reduced from baseline, compared with placebo; mean changes in abdominal pain (assessed on a 5-point scale) from baseline were -0.71, -0.71, -0.90, and -0.86 for linaclotide doses of 75, 150, 300, and 600 \u03bcg, respectively, compared with -0.49 for placebo. Likewise, most doses of linaclotide significantly improved other abdominal symptoms, including discomfort and bloating, and global measures of IBS-C compared with placebo. Effects were observed within the first week and were sustained throughout 12 weeks of treatment. Except for diarrhea, the incidence of adverse events was similar between placebo and linaclotide groups.

Cytomegalovirus reactivation occurs within 6 months in 60-70% of cytomegalovirus-seropositive patients after allogeneic haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT), mainly due to immunosuppression associated with the procedure. Pre-emptive antiviral therapy reduces incidence of cytomegalovirus disease but can be toxic. To reduce the potential for disease and subsequent need for such antiviral drugs, we aimed to assess safety and efficacy of a cytomegalovirus therapeutic DNA vaccine compared with placebo. In this exploratory double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, phase 2 trial, up to 80 donor-recipient pairs and 80 unpaired recipients undergoing allogeneic HSCT were planned for enrolment at 16 transplant centres in the USA. Eligible recipients were cytomegalovirus-seropositive, 18-65 years old, without high-risk primary disease, T-cell depletion, previous vaccination for cytomegalovirus, or autoimmune diseases. We randomly allocated participants in both parallel groups in a 1:1 ratio to receive a cytomegalovirus therapeutic DNA vaccine (TransVax; Vical, San Diego, CA, USA) or placebo before conditioning and at 1, 3, and 6 months after transplantation. The vaccine contains plasmids encoding cytomegalovirus glycoprotein B and phosphoprotein 65 formulated with poloxamer CRL1005 and benzalkonium chloride. Randomisation was done by sequential allocation based on Pocock and Simon's method, and stratified by site, donor-recipient HLA matching status, and donor's cytomegalovirus serostatus. The primary outcome was the occurrence rate of clinically significant viraemia resulting in initiation of cytomegalovirus-specific antiviral therapy in the per-protocol assessable population. We assessed rates of adverse events in all participants who received at least one dose of vaccine or placebo. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00285259. We randomly allocated 108 participants (94 HSCT recipients and 14 paired donors) between June 29, 2006, and Dec 11, 2009. Enrolment of the paired arm was halted in February 2008 for logistical reasons. Safety was assessed in all participants; the efficacy population was restricted to 74 unpaired recipients. Groups were balanced for demographic and clinical variables. 19 (48%) of 40 vaccine recipients required cytomegalovirus-specific antiviral therapy, compared with 21 (62%) of 34 controls (p=0\u00b7145). However, during follow-up vaccine significantly reduced the occurrence and recurrence of cytomegalovirus viraemia and improved the time-to-event for viraemia episodes compared with placebo. The vaccine was well-tolerated; only one participant discontinued after an allergic reaction. Incidence of common adverse events after HSCT (eg, graft-versus-host disease or secondary infections) did not differ between groups. We show proof of concept for an immunotherapeutic cytomegalovirus vaccine (TransVax) for clinically significant viraemia in the HSCT setting.

Open-labeled, multicenter phase 2 dose-ranging studies were performed with BioLVR hydrogel administered to eight subsegmental sites (four in each upper lobe) involving: (1) low-dose treatment (n = 28) with 10 ml per site (LD); and (2) high-dose treatment (n = 22) with 20 ml per site (HD). Safety was assessed by the incidence of serious medical complications. Efficacy was assessed by change from baseline in pulmonary function tests, dyspnea score, 6-minute walk distance, and health-related quality of life. After treatment there were no deaths and four serious treatment-related complications. A reduction in residual volume to TLC ratio at 12 weeks (primary efficacy outcome) was achieved with both LD (-6.4 +/- 9.3%; P = 0.002) and HD (-5.5 +/- 9.4%; P = 0.028) treatments. Improvements in pulmonary function in HD (6 mo: DeltaFEV(1) = +15.6%; P = 0.002; DeltaFVC = +9.1%; P = 0.034) were greater than in LD patients (6 mo: DeltaFEV(1) = +6.7%; P = 0.021; DeltaFVC = +5.1%; P = 0.139). LD- and HD-treated groups both demonstrated improved symptom scores and health-related quality of life.

The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) has shown that supplementation of antioxidants slows the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The mechanism underlying this therapeutic effect may be related to a reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The authors have recently introduced a model showing that the response of retinal blood flow (RBF) to hyperoxia is diminished by administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In the present study, the hypothesis was that this response can be restored by the AREDS medication. Twenty-one healthy volunteers were included in this randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. On each study day, RBF and the reactivity of RBF to hyperoxia were investigated before and after infusion of 2 ng/kg LPS. Between the two study days, subjects took either the AREDS medication or placebo for 14 days. After administration of LPS reduced retinal arterial vasoconstriction during hyperoxia (AREDS group: 12.5% +/- 4.8% pre-LPS vs. 9.4% +/- 4.6% post-LPS; placebo group: 9.2% +/- 3.3% pre-LPS vs. 7.1% +/- 3.5% post-LPS) and a reduced reactivity of RBF during hyperoxia (AREDS: 50.4% +/- 8.9% vs. 44.9% +/- 11.6%, placebo: 54.2% +/- 8.6% vs. 46.0% +/- 6.9%) was found. The reduced responses were normalized after 2 weeks of AREDS antioxidants but not after placebo (vasoconstriction: 13.1% +/- 4.5% vs. 13.1% +/- 5.0% AREDS, 11.2% +/- 4.2 vs. 7.4% +/- 4.2% placebo; RBF: 52.8% +/- 10.5% vs. 52.4% +/- 10.5% AREDS, 52.4% +/- 9.3% vs. 44.2% +/- 6.3% placebo). The sustained retinal vascular reaction to hyperoxia after LPS in the AREDS group indicates that antioxidants reduce oxidative stress-induced endothelial dysfunction, possibly by eliminating ROS.

Antagonism of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptors has been hypothesized as a potential target for the development of novel anxiolytics. This study was designed to determine the safety and efficacy of pexacerfont, a selective CRF-1 receptor antagonist, in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active comparator trial. Two hundred and sixty patients were randomly assigned to pexacerfont 100 mg/day (after a 1 week loading dose of 300 mg/day), placebo or escitalopram 20 mg/day in a 2:2:1 ratio. The primary outcome was the mean change from baseline to end point (week 8) in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale total score. Pexacerfont 100 mg/day did not separate from placebo on the primary outcome measure. The half-powered active comparator arm, escitalopram 20 mg/day, demonstrated efficacy with significant separation from placebo at weeks 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 (P<.02). Response rates for pexacerfont, placebo, and escitalopram were 42, 42, and 53%, respectively. Genetic and psychometric rating scale data was obtained in 175 randomized subjects. There was a significant association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the gene encoding plexin A2 (PLXNA2-2016) with the HAM-A psychic subscale score for the entire cohort at baseline (FDR-adjusted P=.015). Pexacerfont did not demonstrate efficacy compared to placebo for the treatment of GAD. Whether these findings are generalizable to this class of agents remains to be determined.

Although the protein catabolic effects of metabolic acidosis are well established, it is unclear whether the entire reference range of arterial pH (7.37-7.44) is equivalent for protein balance. We undertook this study to test the hypothesis that in patients undergoing automated peritoneal dialysis, an arterial pH of 7.43-7.45, as compared with a pH of 7.36-7.38, is associated with more-positive nitrogen balances. Eight stable subjects (5 men) aged 43.1 +/- 15.3 y completed a randomized, crossover nitrogen balance study for >or=42 d. Arterial pH was varied by changing the daily doses of sodium citrate/citric acid and ammonium chloride. The subjects attained mean (+/-SD) arterial pH values of 7.37 +/- 0.01 and 7.44 +/- 0.02 during the low-normal and high-normal pH phases, respectively. The higher arterial pH was associated with higher net nitrogen balances (3.22 +/- 1.37 compared with 2.29 +/- 2.18 g/d; P = 0.06), lower serum urea nitrogen (54.1 +/- 13.7 compared with 64.4 +/- 20.2 mg/dL; P = 0.01), higher fasting leucine flux (P = 0.02), and increased fasting total-body protein synthesis (P = 0.01) and degradation (P = 0.02).

Pain questions from the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaire were used to assess symptoms. We calculated means for total WOMAC pain in relation to varus thrust and static varus alignment (i.e., corrected anatomic alignment<178 degrees). Ordinal logistic regressions were performed, with responses on individual WOMAC pain questions as the outcomes and varus thrust and varus alignment as the predictors. There were 82 participants, 60% of whom were female. The mean\u00b1SD age was 65.1\u00b18.5 years, and the mean\u00b1SD body mass index was 30.2\u00b15.4 kg/m2.

To determine whether n-3 decreases proinflammatory cytokine production and depressive and anxiety symptoms in healthy young adults, this parallel group, placebo-controlled, double-blind 12-week RCT compared n-3 supplementation with placebo. The participants, 68 medical students, provided serial blood samples during lower-stress periods as well as on days before an exam. The students received either n-3 (2.5 g/d, 2085 mg eicosapentaenoic acid and 348 mg docosahexanoic acid) or placebo capsules that mirrored the proportions of fatty acids in the typical American diet. Compared to controls, those students who received n-3 showed a 14% decrease in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated interleukin 6 (IL-6) production and a 20% reduction in anxiety symptoms, without significant change in depressive symptoms. Individuals differ in absorption and metabolism of n-3 PUFA supplements, as well as in adherence; accordingly, planned secondary analyses that used the plasma n-6:n-3 ratio in place of treatment group showed that decreasing n-6:n-3 ratios led to lower anxiety and reductions in stimulated IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) production, as well as marginal differences in serum TNF-\u03b1. These data suggest that n-3 supplementation can reduce inflammation and anxiety even among healthy young adults. The reduction in anxiety symptoms associated with n-3 supplementation provides the first evidence that n-3 may have potential anxiolytic benefits for individuals without an anxiety disorder diagnosis.

We assess the efficacy and safety of the TNFalpha inhibitor golimumab in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who had previously received one or more TNFalpha inhibitors. 461 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis from 82 sites in 10 countries were randomly allocated by interactive voice response system, stratified by study site and methotrexate use, to receive subcutaneous injections of placebo (n=155), 50 mg golimumab (n=153), or 100 mg golimumab (n=153) every 4 weeks between Feb 21, 2006, and Sept 26, 2007. Allocation was double-blind. Eligible patients had been treated with at least one dose of a TNFalpha inhibitor previously. Patients continued stable doses of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, oral corticosteroids, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The primary endpoint was achievement at week 14 of 20% or higher improvement in American College of Rheumatology criteria for assessment of rheumatoid arthritis (ACR20).

By inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, statins not only reduce cholesterol biosynthesis but also decrease the formation of isoprenoids, which are important for mediating signaling through the Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) pathway. Increased ROCK activity has been implicated in endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation. We hypothesize that ezetimibe, which inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption, may not exert similar cholesterol-independent or pleiotropic effects of statins and, when used with a lower dose of statin, have less effect on ROCK activity than a higher dose of statin. In a prospective, randomized, observer-blinded study, we treated 60 dyslipidemic subjects without cardiovascular disease with simvastatin 40 mg/d, simvastatin/ezetimibe 10/10 mg/d, or placebo tablets for 28 days (n=20 in each arm). We evaluated baseline demographics and lipid levels, ROCK activity, C-reactive protein, and flow-mediated dilation before and after treatment. Compared with the placebo group, both treatment regimens decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 38% and C-reactive protein by 38% to 40% after 28 days (P<0.01 for both compared with placebo). Although the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and C-reactive protein reductions were comparable with either lipid-lowering regimen, only simvastatin 40 mg reduced ROCK activity and improved flow-mediated dilation (P<0.01 for both compared with baseline). Reduction in ROCK activity with simvastatin 40 mg remained significant even after controlling for changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=0.01) and correlated with improvement in flow-mediated dilation (R(2)=-0.78, P<0.01). No correlation was found between changes in flow-mediated dilation and changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or C-reactive protein. These results indicate that high-dose statin monotherapy exerts greater effects on ROCK activity and endothelial function, but not on C-reactive protein, than low-dose statin plus ezetimibe. These findings provide additional evidence of statin benefits beyond cholesterol lowering.

However, during post-intervention follow-up, CM participants were somewhat more likely to provide urine samples containing methamphetamine than control participants (aRR = 1.21; 95%CI: 0.95, 1.54, P = 0.11). Compared to control participants, CM participants were significantly more likely to report weekly or more frequent methamphetamine use and use of more than eight quarters of methamphetamine during the intervention and post-intervention periods. While it is possible to enroll and retain MSM who use methamphetamine in a trial of CM conducted outside drug treatment, our data suggest that CM is not likely to have a large, sustained effect on methamphetamine use.

Meningococcal serogroup-specific serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA), and antibodies to Tdap antigens and HPV virus-like particles were determined before and 1 month after study vaccinations. Proportions of subjects with hSBA titres > or =1:8 for all four meningococcal serogroups (A, C, W-135, Y) were non-inferior for both concomitant and sequential administration. Immune responses to Tdap and HPV antigens were comparable when these vaccines were given alone or concomitantly with MenACWY-CRM. All vaccines were well tolerated; concomitant or sequential administration did not increase reactogenicity. MenACWY-CRM was well tolerated and immunogenic in subjects 11-18 years of age, with comparable immune responses to the four serogroups when given alone or concomitantly with Tdap or HPV antigens. This is the first demonstration that these currently recommended adolescent vaccines could be administered concomitantly without causing increased reactogenicity.

Secondary endpoints were microvascular obstruction and myocardial salvage, early ST-segment resolution, and a composite of death, repeated myocardial infarctions, and congestive heart failure within 30 days. The median time from symptom onset to randomization was 64 min (interquartile range [IQR]: 42 to 103 min) in Group A versus 55 min in Group B (IQR: 27 to 91 min; p = 0.26).

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors combined with higher doses of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), that is, 25 mg daily, have been recognized as an effective form of antihypertensive therapy. To evaluate the coadministration of 20 mg ramipril with 25 mg HCT, we carried out a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial with two dose schedules of ramipril (20 mg q.d. and 10 mg b.i.d.) and HCT monotherapy arms as comparators in 354 patients with stage 2 hypertension. The clinic blood pressure (BP) was assessed using a semiautomatic digital device and 24-h BP was measured using ambulatory BP recordings at baseline and after 8 weeks of therapy. At baseline, the demographics and baseline BP values were similar in the four treatment groups (age: 51-53 years, 52-58% male, 64-68% non-black, clinic BP: 155-158/103-104 mm Hg). Ramipril-HCT induced significantly greater reductions in both the clinic and ambulatory BP than the HCT and ramipril monotherapy treatments (for example, additional reductions in ambulatory BP on ramipril-HCT ranged from -7.3/-5.2 to -10.3/-7.4 mm Hg compared to the monotherapies, all P<0.001). Reductions from baseline were still numerically greater for the clinic BPs derived from device measurements than those for the BP values derived from 24-h ambulatory BP measurements (changes in clinic diastolic BP ranged from -8.5 to -15.5 mm Hg across treatment groups, whereas changes in ambulatory diastolic BP were -4.7 to -12.0 mm Hg for the same groups). Thus, these data support the use of ambulatory BP monitoring even when automated BP devices are used for the assessment of clinical BP in trials that attempt to differentiate BP responses among active comparator groups. In conclusion, based on its efficacy and tolerability profile the combination of ramipril and HCT was shown to be effective therapy for the treatment of stage 2 hypertension.

We report the first study of the cardiac myosin activator, omecamtiv mecarbil, in patients with systolic heart failure. We undertook a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial investigating the effects of omecamtiv mecarbil (formerly CK-1827452), given intravenously for 2, 24, or 72 h to patients with stable heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction receiving guideline-indicated treatment. Clinical assessment (including vital signs, echocardiograms, and electrocardiographs) and testing of plasma drug concentrations took place during and after completion of each infusion. The primary aim was to assess safety and tolerability of omecamtiv mecarbil. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00624442. 45 patients received 151 infusions of active drug or placebo. Placebo-corrected, concentration-dependent increases in left ventricular ejection time (up to an 80 ms increase from baseline) and stroke volume (up to 9\u00b77 mL) were recorded, associated with a small reduction in heart rate (up to 2\u00b77 beats per min; p<0\u00b70001 for all three measures).

Pneumococcal geometric mean antibody concentrations (GMCs) and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) geometric mean titers were measured. Postprimary immune responses were consistent with those in previous PHiD-CV and 7vCRM studies. Following 23vPS boosting, vaccine serotype-specific antibody GMCs increased 6.5- to 33.3-fold and 4.8- to 32.2-fold versus prebooster in the PHiD-CV and 7vCRM groups, respectively. Postbooster OPA titers increased 2.8- to 38.8-fold and 2.6- to 58.9-fold, respectively. Postbooster antibody GMCs exceeded postprimary levels but, for some serotypes, postbooster OPA geometric mean titers were lower than postprimary in both groups. An additional dose of the same PCV received for priming was administered to 52 children aged 46 to 50 months, resulting in higher responses versus postprimary vaccination for all serotypes, but not always higher than post-23vPS booster. Induction of immunologic memory following PHiD-CV priming was confirmed. Additional PCV boosting in 4-year-olds did not provide strong evidence of hyporesponsiveness induced by previous 23vPS boosting. However, our results did not rule out depletion of the memory B cell pool following 23vPS vaccination, resulting in subsequent attenuated immune responses, and therefore support the use of PCV rather than 23vPS for booster vaccination in the second year of life.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS Sensitive outcome measures to assess the efficacy of therapeutic interventions in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) with mild lung disease are currently lacking. Our objective was to study the ability of the lung clearance index (LCI), a measure of ventilation inhomogeneity, to detect a treatment response to hypertonic saline inhalation in paediatric patients with CF with normal spirometry. METHODS In a crossover trial, 20 patients with CF received 4 weeks of hypertonic saline (HS) and isotonic saline (IS) in a randomised sequence separated by a 4 week washout period. The primary end point was the change in the LCI due to HS versus IS. RESULTS Baseline characteristics including the LCI were not significantly different between both study periods. Four weeks of twice-daily HS inhalation significantly improved the LCI compared with IS (1.16, 95% CI 0.26 to 2.05; p=0.016), whereas other outcome measures such as spirometry and quality of life failed to reach statistical significance. Randomisation order had no significant impact on the treatment effect. CONCLUSIONS The LCI, but not spirometry was able to detect a treatment effect from HS inhalation in patients with CF with mild disease and may be a suitable tool to assess early intervention strategies in this patient population.

In two identically designed, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (TARGET 1 and TARGET 2), patients who had IBS without constipation were randomly assigned to either rifaximin at a dose of 550 mg or placebo, three times daily for 2 weeks, and were followed for an additional 10 weeks. The primary end point, the proportion of patients who had adequate relief of global IBS symptoms, and the key secondary end point, the proportion of patients who had adequate relief of IBS-related bloating, were assessed weekly. Adequate relief was defined as self-reported relief of symptoms for at least 2 of the first 4 weeks after treatment. Other secondary end points included the percentage of patients who had a response to treatment as assessed by daily self-ratings of global IBS symptoms and individual symptoms of bloating, abdominal pain, and stool consistency during the 4 weeks after treatment and during the entire 3 months of the study. Significantly more patients in the rifaximin group than in the placebo group had adequate relief of global IBS symptoms during the first 4 weeks after treatment (40.8% vs. 31.2%, P=0.01, in TARGET 1; 40.6% vs. 32.2%, P=0.03, in TARGET 2; 40.7% vs. 31.7%, P<0.001, in the two studies combined).

Most smoking cessation programs advise abrupt rather than gradual cessation. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of gradual cessation (n=297) vs. abrupt cessation (n=299) vs. minimal treatment (n=150) among smokers who wanted to quit now and preferred to quit gradually. Participants were recruited via newspaper and radio advertisements. The gradual and abrupt conditions received five phone calls (total=90 min) and the minimal treatment condition received two calls (25 min total). The gradual condition received nicotine lozenge (via mail) to reduce smoking prior to their quit date. After the quit day, all participants received lozenge. The primary outcome was prolonged abstinence from 2 weeks post-quit day through 6 months. Prior to the quit day, the gradual condition decreased cigarettes/day by 54%, whereas the other two conditions decreased by 1% and 5%. Prolonged abstinence rates (CO<10 ppm) did not differ among gradual, abrupt and minimal treatment conditions (4%, 7% and 5%), nor did 7-day point prevalence rates (7%, 11% and 11%). Fewer smokers in the gradual condition (48%) made a quit attempt than in the abrupt (64%) or minimal (60%) conditions (p<.001). In the gradual condition, every week delay to the quit date increased the probability of lapsing by 19% (p<.001). We conclude that among smokers who want to stop gradually in the near future, gradual cessation with nicotine pre-treatment does not produce higher quit rates than abrupt cessation.

To examine short- and long-term clinical efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacological treatment in older adults experiencing chronic primary insomnia. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 46 adults (mean age, 60.8 y; 22 women) with chronic primary insomnia conducted between January 2004 and December 2005 in a single Norwegian university-based outpatient clinic for adults and elderly patients.

All treatment duration was 6 weeks, and the 2 active treatments were followed up at 6 months. Ambulant clinical polysomnographic data and sleep diaries were used to determine total wake time, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and slow-wave sleep (only assessed using polysomnography) on all 3 assessment points. CBT resulted in improved short- and long-term outcomes compared with zopiclone on 3 out of 4 outcome measures. For most outcomes, zopiclone did not differ from placebo. Participants receiving CBT improved their sleep efficiency from 81.4% at pretreatment to 90.1% at 6-month follow-up compared with a decrease from 82.3% to 81.9% in the zopiclone group. Participants in the CBT group spent much more time in slow-wave sleep (stages 3 and 4) compared with those in other groups, and spent less time awake during the night. Total sleep time was similar in all 3 groups; at 6 months, patients receiving CBT had better sleep efficiency using polysomnography than those taking zopiclone.

The 90-min PPG (blood glucose area under the curve for 0-1.5 h) for ID RHI was 14% lower than SC RHI at -17 min (P < 0.0001) and 11% lower than ID RHI at -2 min (P = 0.0006). PPG did not differ between ID RHI and SC IL, both at -2 min (P = 0.8345). ID IL PPG was lower than SC, both at -2 min, but not significantly (P = 0.10). Both ID IL and ID RHI PK data showed significantly faster uptake and time to maximum concentration, higher maximum concentration, and shorter systemic circulating duration versus SC dosing. ID IL and RHI delivery was generally well tolerated. PPG with RHI administered ID via microneedle was improved versus SC delivery when dosed 17 min premeal. ID RHI provided similar control of PPG as SC IL immediately premeal. Further studies of ID insulin delivery via steel microneedles are warranted.

Although atypical antipsychotic agents have been found effective in the augmentation of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) for treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in short-term trials, there are few data on the effectiveness and safety of these agents in clinical settings over the long term. Subjects (N = 46) who responded to selective SRIs (SSRIs) in an initial 12-week trial were continued on SSRI monotherapy plus cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for 1 year. Subjects (N = 44) who failed to respond to SSRIs were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 atypical antipsychotics -- olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone -- and were consecutively treated using SSRI + atypical antipsychotics combined with CBT for 1 year. This study was conducted from January 2006 to November 2007 at Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine Hospital, Japan. Augmentation with atypical antipsychotics reduced mean +/- SD Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) total scores in SSRI-refractory OCD patients (at initial assessment = 29.3 +/- 9.9, after 1 year = 19.3 +/- 6.8). However, compared to SSRI responders (at initial assessment = 25.8 +/- 11.4, after 1 year = 13.7 +/- 4.6), total YBOCS scores in those who required atypical antipsychotic augmentation were initially higher, and they remained at higher levels than those of SRI responders after 1 year of the treatments. Our work does not sufficiently support the long-term effectiveness of the atypical antipsychotics in the augmentation of SSRIs for treatment-resistant OCD patients. Even though this approach seems useful for some types of OCD patients, such as those with symmetry/ordering and hoarding symptoms, these data emphasize the limitations of the current pharmacotherapeutic options in treatment-refractory OCD, and their chronic use raises a number of safety concerns.

The aim of study was to compare the results of different surgical modalities - mesh (onlay vs. sublay position) and suture repair - in the treatment of abdominal wall hernias. A five-year randomized, multicentric, internet-based, clinical trial was started in 2002. 953 patients were included in the study and divided into two groups according to the size of hernia orifice. In group 'A' ( n = 494) the surface of hernia orifice was between 5-25 cm 2 (small hernia), and in group 'B' ( n = 459) it was above 25 cm 2 (large hernia). Patients of these two groups were randomized according to surgery: group 'A' (suture vs. mesh) and in group 'B' (mesh in onlay vs. sublay position). In group 'A' suture repair was performed in 247, and sublay mesh implantation in 247 cases. In group 'B' sublay ( n = 235) and onlay ( n = 224) mesh reconstruction was performed.

A total of 455 subjects (455 study eyes: 230 bromfenac, 225 placebo) were enrolled in two randomized double-masked, placebo-controlled, clinical trials at 64 ophthalmology clinics in the United States. Subjects were randomized to receive either bromfenac 0.09% or placebo dosed once daily. Dosing began 1 day before cataract surgery (Day -1), continued on day of surgery (Day 0), and for 14 days following surgery. Evaluations were completed on Days 1, 3, 8, 15 and 22. The primary efficacy endpoint was cleared summed ocular inflammation score (SOIS) by Day 15. The secondary efficacy endpoint was the number of subjects who were pain-free at Day 1. The bromfenac 0.09% group was significantly higher compared to the placebo group in the primary endpoint of the proportion of subjects who had cleared ocular inflammation by Day 15 (P < 0.0001). The mean SOIS for the bromfenac 0.09% group was lower than the placebo group at Days 3, 8, 15, and 22 (P < 0.0001). More bromfenac 0.09% subjects were pain free at Days 1, 3, 8, and 15 (P < 0.0001). Fewer subjects in the bromfenac 0.09% group withdrew from the clinical trials due to lack of efficacy at Day 15 (P < 0.0001). Fewer adverse events were reported in the bromfenac 0.09% group than the placebo group. Limitations included advanced age, female predominance, and surgical nuances among cataract surgeons, making cross-trial comparisons difficult.

Clinical trials investigating the effect of adjunctive vitamin D on sputum culture conversion are absent. We undertook a multicentre randomised controlled trial of adjunctive vitamin D in adults with sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis in London, UK. 146 patients were allocated to receive 2\u00b75 mg vitamin D(3) or placebo at baseline and 14, 28, and 42 days after starting standard tuberculosis treatment. The primary endpoint was time from initiation of antimicrobial treatment to sputum culture conversion. Patients were genotyped for TaqI and FokI polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor, and interaction analyses were done to assess the influence of the vitamin D receptor genotype on response to vitamin D(3). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00419068. 126 patients were included in the primary efficacy analysis (62 assigned to intervention, 64 assigned to placebo). Median time to sputum culture conversion was 36\u00b70 days in the intervention group and 43\u00b75 days in the placebo group (adjusted hazard ratio 1\u00b739, 95% CI 0\u00b790-2\u00b716; p=0.14).

Armodafinil, prescribed principally to treat narcolepsy, is undergoing assessment of therapeutic potential for other neuropsychiatric disorders and medical conditions. The neurochemical substrates and mechanisms of armodafinil are unresolved. We investigated the hypothesis that armodafinil enhances wakefulness by modulating the activities of the dopamine transporter (DAT). With positron emission tomography imaging, we determined DAT occupancy and changes in extracellular dopamine by armodafinil in vivo. Twelve subjects were enrolled. Plasma armodafinil levels were obtained. In vivo armodafinil occupancy of the DAT in striatum was detected by [\u00b9\u00b9C]altropane and changes in extracellular dopamine were detected by indirect displacement of [\u00b9\u00b9C]raclopride in human subjects at different times after drug administration. Armodafinil (100 mg by mouth [PO]) occupied striatal DAT (34.0 \u00b1 9.0% at 1 hour, 40.4 \u00b1 9.5% at 2.5 hours, n = 6) and 250 mg occupied striatal DAT (60.5 \u00b1 7.4% at 1 hour, 65.2 \u00b1 6.1% at 2.5 hours, n = 6).

We compared the effects of naltrexone with those of placebo in a sample of 163 individuals (58.3% male) whose goal was to reduce their drinking to safe limits. Patients received study medication (ie, naltrexone 50 mg or placebo) and were instructed to use it daily or targeted to situations identified by them as being high risk for heavy drinking. An interactive voice response system was used to obtain daily reports of drinking and medication use during the 12-week trial. Analyses were conducted using hierarchical linear modeling, with sex as a potential moderator variable. On the primary outcome measure, mean drinks per day, at week 12, men in the targeted naltrexone group drank significantly less than patients in the other groups did. On a secondary outcome measure, drinks per drinking day, during week 12, the targeted naltrexone group drank significantly less than the other groups did, with no moderating effect of sex. These results support the use of a targeted approach to reduce drinking among heavy drinkers, particularly men, but argue for the use of additional strategies or more efficacious medications than naltrexone to increase the effects of such an intervention.

Topical calcipotriene is frequently prescribed for the treatment of plaque-type psoriasis. Calcipotriene is currently available in the US as an ointment, a solution, a cream, and in a fixed-dose combination ointment with betamethasone dipropionate. Calcipotriene 0.005% has recently been formulated as a foam using a novel aqueous-based formulation to provide a new topical treatment option for patients with psoriasis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical calcipotriene 0.005% foam for the treatment of mild to moderate plaque-type psoriasis. Two identical, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, 8-week phase III clinical trials. Subjects with plaque-type psoriasis affecting 2-20% of the body surface area, with an identifiable target lesion affecting the trunk or extremities, were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to calcipotriene foam (n = 437) or vehicle foam (n = 222). Study medication was applied twice daily for 8 weeks. Treatment success was defined as a score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear) on the Investigator's Static Global Assessment (ISGA) psoriasis rating scale and a minimum improvement of ISGA score of at least 2 grades from baseline. Predefined target lesions were assessed for erythema, scaling, and plaque thickness. Primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects in each treatment group who achieved treatment success after 8 weeks, analyzed on an intent-to-treat (ITT) basis. In the primary endpoint analysis, subjects missing 8-week outcomes data were classified as treatment failures regardless of their outcomes at earlier evaluations. As part of the sensitivity analysis, a last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) approach to impute missing 8-week efficacy outcomes also examined treatment. Secondary endpoints included treatment success as a function of baseline ISGA score (mild or moderate), ISGA score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear), and effects of treatment on target lesion. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the study. In the ITT population of Study 1, treatment success after 8 weeks was achieved by 14% of subjects in the calcipotriene foam group versus 7% of subjects in the vehicle foam group (p = 0.058). In the LOCF analysis, treatment success was achieved by more subjects with calcipotriene foam than with vehicle foam (15% vs 7%; p = 0.034). In Study 2, treatment success was achieved by more subjects in the calcipotriene foam group for the primary endpoint (27% vs 16%; p = 0.016) and the LOCF analysis (28% vs 16%; p = 0.010). Subjects in the calcipotriene foam group exhibited better response rates than did the vehicle foam group for most of the secondary outcomes. Calcipotriene foam was safe with an overall incidence of AEs similar to those experienced in the vehicle foam group. Application-site reactions were noted in approximately 1-2% of subjects in each group. No AE was reported in more than 2% of subjects in the calcipotriene foam group. Treatment was discontinued because of AEs in approximately 2% of subjects in both groups. In two identically designed, phase III clinical trials, calcipotriene 0.005% foam was safe and effective for the treatment of mild to moderate plaque-type psoriasis for up to 8 weeks.

Recent clinical data suggest that early administration of vasopressin analogues may be advantageous compared to a last resort therapy. However, it is still unknown whether vasopressin and terlipressin are equally effective for hemodynamic support in septic shock. The aim of the present prospective, randomized, controlled pilot trial study was, therefore, to compare the impact of continuous infusions of either vasopressin or terlipressin, when given as first-line therapy in septic shock patients, on open-label norepinephrine requirements. We enrolled septic shock patients (n = 45) with a mean arterial pressure below 65 mmHg despite adequate volume resuscitation. Patients were randomized to receive continuous infusions of either terlipressin (1.3 microg.kg-1.h-1), vasopressin (.03 U.min-1) or norepinephrine (15 microg.min-1; n = 15 per group). In all groups, open-label norepinephrine was added to achieve a mean arterial pressure between 65 and 75 mmHg, if necessary. Data from right heart and thermo-dye dilution catheterization, gastric tonometry, as well as laboratory variables of organ function were obtained at baseline, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours after randomization. Differences within and between groups were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA for repeated measurements with group and time as factors. Time-independent variables were compared with one-way ANOVA. There were no differences among groups in terms of systemic and regional hemodynamics. Compared with infusion of .03 U of vasopressin or 15 microg.min-1 of norepinephrine, 1.3 microg.kg-1.h-1 of terlipressin allowed a marked reduction in catecholamine requirements (0.8 +/- 1.3 and 1.2 +/- 1.4 vs. 0.2 +/- 0.4 microg.kg-1.min-1 at 48 hours; each P < 0.05) and was associated with less rebound hypotension (P < 0.05). At the end of the 48-hour intervention period, bilirubin concentrations were higher in the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups as compared with the terlipressin group (2.3 +/- 2.8 and 2.8 +/- 2.5 vs. 0.9 +/- 0.3 mg.dL-1; each P < 0.05). A time-dependent decrease in platelet count was only observed in the terlipressin group (P < 0.001 48 hours vs. BL). The present study provides evidence that continuous infusion of low-dose terlipressin--when given as first-line vasopressor agent in septic shock--is effective in reversing sepsis-induced arterial hypotension and in reducing norepinephrine requirements.

In this randomized, placebo-controlled study with an enriched enrollment design, the buprenorphine transdermal system (BTDS) was found to be efficacious and generally well tolerated. This enriched, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study evaluated the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of BTDS in opioid-na\u00efve patients who had moderate to severe chronic low back pain. Patients who tolerated and responded to BTDS (10 or 20 mcg/hour) during an open-label run-in period were randomized to continue BTDS 10 or 20 mcg/hour or receive matching placebo. The primary outcome was \"average pain over the last 24 hours\" at the end of the 12-week double-blind phase, collected on an 11-point scale (0=no pain, 10=pain as bad as you can imagine). Sleep disturbance (Medical Outcomes Study subscale) and total number of supplemental analgesic tablets used were secondary efficacy variables. Fifty-three percent of patients receiving open-label BTDS (541 of 1024) were randomized to receive BTDS (n=257) or placebo (n=284). Patients receiving BTDS reported statistically significantly lower pain scores at Week 12 compared with placebo (least square mean treatment difference: -0.58, P=0.010). Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy variable and results of the analysis of secondary efficacy variables supported the efficacy of BTDS relative to placebo. During the double-blind phase, the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was 55% for the BTDS treatment group and 52% for the placebo treatment group. Laboratory, vital sign, and electrocardiogram evaluations did not reveal unanticipated safety findings.
