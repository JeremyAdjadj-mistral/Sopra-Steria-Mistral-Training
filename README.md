## Agents Hackathon

It's your turn to build agentic workflows! 

In teams of 6, youâ€™ll have 2 hours to work on a topic of your choice and build a use case that showcases the capabilities of the Agent SDK. 

Feel free to use built-in connectors, create new tools, and more! 


At 5:00 PM, each team will give a short 5-minute presentation (with or without slides) to share what they built with the rest of the group!


You can create a dedicated directory in the Git repo and get started ðŸš€

cd Sopra-Steria-Mistral-Training
mkdir agentic-hackathon-your-team-name
cd agentic-hackathon-your-team-name
touch README.md
```
Edit the README.md to describe your use case.

Then commit and push :
